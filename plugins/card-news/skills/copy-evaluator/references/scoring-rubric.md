# Scoring Rubric

> Detailed 1 / 3 / 5 point criteria for each copy-evaluator dimension.
> Use this as the authoritative reference when scoring card-news copy.

## 1. Hook Power (Weight: 25%)

The cover card's ability to stop the scroll in under 1 second.

| Score | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **5** | Accent + keyword + title form an irresistible hook. Creates curiosity gap or emotional spike. Reader MUST swipe. | accent: "어머!" / keyword: "연봉 5천" / title: "비결은?" → immediate curiosity |
| **3** | Decent hook but predictable. Informative but doesn't create urgency or emotional pull. | accent: "알아보자" / keyword: "취업 팁" / title: "정리" → useful but flat |
| **1** | Generic or confusing. Could be any topic. No reason to swipe. | accent: "안녕" / keyword: "정보" / title: "모음" → zero specificity |

**Key signals for high scores:**
- Curiosity gap (open loop that content cards close)
- Specificity (numbers, names, concrete nouns)
- Emotional trigger (surprise, fear of missing out, desire)
- accent-text amplifies the headline (not redundant)

## 2. Narrative Flow (Weight: 20%)

How well the story progresses from cover to outro.

| Score | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **5** | Clear 3-act structure: hook → develop → resolve. Each card builds on the previous. Outro feels earned. | Cover hooks with question → content-image provides context → content-features gives details → outro wraps with CTA |
| **3** | Content cards are individually good but feel disconnected. Transitions are mechanical rather than narrative. | Cards cover different aspects of topic but could be reordered without impact |
| **1** | No progression. Cards repeat the same point or jump randomly. Outro is disconnected from content. | Cover about topic A, content about topic B, outro generic |

**Key signals for high scores:**
- Each card adds NEW information (not restated)
- Natural "and then..." flow between cards
- Outro references or resolves something from the cover
- Reader wants to swipe forward (not backward)

## 3. Information Density (Weight: 15%)

Value per character — is every word earning its place?

| Score | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **5** | Every line teaches something or provokes thought. No filler words. Character limits force precision, and this copy delivers. | body: "기준금리 3.5% 동결" → specific data in minimal chars |
| **3** | Most lines have substance but some are padding. A few "which is to say" or "in other words" equivalents. | body: "앞으로도 지켜봐야 합니다" → true but adds nothing |
| **1** | Mostly filler or vague statements. Could delete half the text without losing meaning. | body: "이것은 매우 중요한 것입니다" → says nothing specific |

**Key signals for high scores:**
- Concrete nouns and verbs (not abstract)
- Numbers, data, specifics where applicable
- No redundancy between title and body
- Feature descriptions each provide unique insight

## 4. Brand Voice (Weight: 15%)

Consistency with the brand personality defined in voice-profile.md.

| Score | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **5** | Copy sounds exactly like the brand speaking. Tone, vocabulary, and personality are unmistakable. Even without branding, you'd recognize the voice. | If brand is "friendly expert": warm tone + authoritative data, no jargon |
| **3** | Broadly on-brand but generic. Could be any similar brand. No personality violations, but no standout voice moments. | Professional and correct but lacks the brand's distinctive flavor |
| **1** | Off-brand. Tone contradicts voice-profile. Uses vocabulary the brand would never use. | Formal brand writing slang, or casual brand writing corporate jargon |

**Key signals for high scores:**
- Vocabulary matches voice-profile word preferences
- Tone is consistent from cover to outro (no personality shifts)
- Brand's unique expressions or catchphrases naturally woven in
- Avoids voice-profile "Don't" items

**Note:** If brand-memory/voice-profile.md is missing, score based on internal consistency only (is the tone consistent across all cards?). Default score: 3.

## 5. Highlight Relevance (Weight: 10%)

Are the yellow-highlighted keywords truly the most important terms?

| Score | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **5** | Highlighted keywords are the exact terms readers should remember. They carry the card's core message. Scanning just the highlights tells the story. | "기준금리" highlighted in a monetary policy card → perfect |
| **3** | Keywords are relevant but not the most impactful choice. Decent but could be stronger. | "경제 상황" highlighted → too vague, "기준금리 동결" would be better |
| **1** | Keywords are filler words, verbs, or generic terms that don't carry meaning. | "하는 것" highlighted → zero informational value |

**Key signals for high scores:**
- Highlights are nouns or noun phrases (not verbs or adjectives)
- Scanning only highlights across all cards gives a coherent summary
- Keywords would be the terms used in a search query
- No highlight wasted on common/generic words

---

## 6. CTA Strength (Weight: 10%)

Does the outro motivate action?

| Score | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **5** | Outro creates a specific, emotionally resonant reason to act. Clear action + clear benefit. | "저장하고 월급날에 다시 보세요" → specific action + specific timing |
| **3** | Standard CTA present but generic. "팔로우 해주세요" or "좋아요 눌러주세요" level. | Works but doesn't stand out from any other card-news |
| **1** | No CTA, or CTA is disconnected from the content. "감사합니다" with no action prompt. | Outro is just a goodbye, no engagement motivation |

**Key signals for high scores:**
- Action is specific (save, share with [who], bookmark for [when])
- Benefit is tied to the content topic
- Emotional close that creates warmth or urgency
- Natural, not forced or salesy

---

## 7. Korean Naturalness (Weight: 5%)

Does the copy read like it was written by a native Korean speaker?

| Score | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **5** | Perfectly natural Korean. Particles, endings, rhythm all feel native. Would pass as human-written editorial copy. | Natural sentence endings, appropriate 조사, rhythmic flow |
| **3** | Grammatically correct but slightly stiff. Minor awkwardness in particle choice or sentence structure. | "이것은 중요합니다" → correct but formal for card-news tone |
| **1** | Translation-style Korean (번역체). Wrong particles, unnatural word order, or forced expressions. | "그것은 ~에 대해 관련된 것입니다" → clearly translated |

**Key signals for high scores:**
- Sentence endings vary naturally (해요/합니다/이다 mix or consistent register)
- Particles are correct and natural (은/는, 이/가, 을/를 choices)
- No English-style syntax forced into Korean grammar
- Colloquial expressions used appropriately for the tone
