# Trend Scout

> Scan current industry trends and convert them into brand-aligned content angles.
> Uses Perplexity for trend discovery. Output feeds post-writer, series-planner, and image-creator.

---

## Purpose

Trend Scout is the **research bridge** between foundation skills (visual-extractor, framework-builder) and content skills (post-writer, series-planner). It answers:

- What topics are trending in our category RIGHT NOW?
- How can our brand authentically connect to each trend?
- Which trends are urgent vs. evergreen?
- What platform is best for each angle?

The output — `creative-memory/trend-angles.md` — becomes the **content direction layer** that post-writer and series-planner read to choose what to write about.

---

## Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Full Scan** | No `trend-angles.md` exists, or it's empty/scaffold only | Run all 5 steps from scratch |
| **Refresh** | `trend-angles.md` already has data | Check `creative-log.md` for last scan date → update stale trends, preserve evergreen angles |

---

## Auto-Load Protocol

On every invocation, BEFORE any research:

1. **Check `creative-memory/` directory** → If missing, create it
2. **Read `brand-memory/voice-profile.md`** (read-only) → Brand tone for angle framing
3. **Read `brand-memory/positioning.md`** (read-only) → Core positioning = the lens for trend-to-angle conversion
4. **Read ALL `.md` files in `creative-memory/`** (except README.md) → Existing guidelines, frameworks, log
5. **Optional: Read `research-memory/market-landscape.md`** (read-only) → Market trends, seasonality context
6. If `trend-angles.md` has data AND `creative-log.md` shows a previous trend-scout run → **suggest Refresh mode**

---

## Input Gathering

Collect from the user conversationally. Do NOT dump a form — ask naturally.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Brand category / Industry | YES | What space does the brand operate in? |
| Target audience | YES | Who are we creating content for? |
| Focus keywords | Optional | Specific topics or angles to explore |
| Platform priority | Optional | Which platforms matter most? |

**If brand-memory/ exists**, pre-fill category and audience from `positioning.md` — ask user to confirm or correct.

**If this is a Refresh**, show the current trend-angles.md summary and ask: "Any specific direction you want to explore, or should I scan broadly for what's new?"

---

## Process

### Step 1: Context Load + Input Collection

**Goal**: Establish brand context and determine scan scope.

1. Execute Auto-Load Protocol (above)
2. Extract from `positioning.md`: brand category, core positioning, target audience, key differentiators
3. If `positioning.md` missing → ask user directly for category + positioning
4. Determine mode: Full Scan (no existing data) or Refresh (existing data found)
5. For Refresh: parse existing `trend-angles.md` to identify current trends and their dates

**Output**: Clear brand context + mode decision + scope of search.

---

### Step 2: Trend Discovery (Perplexity)

**Goal**: Identify 3-5 current trends relevant to the brand's category and audience.

**Tool**: `perplexity_ask`

**Query pattern (Full Scan)**:
```
What are the top 3-5 trending topics in the [category] space right now that brands can leverage for social media content?

For each trend:
- Name the trend in 3-5 words
- Explain why it's trending NOW (what triggered it)
- Describe who cares about this (audience overlap with [target audience])
- Estimate how long this trend will remain relevant (days, weeks, months)
- Name 1-2 platforms where this trend is most active

Focus on trends that a [brand type] brand could authentically participate in.
```

**Query pattern (Refresh)**:
```
Here are the trends we identified previously for [category]:
[list existing trends from trend-angles.md]

Which of these are still relevant? What new trends have emerged since [last scan date]?
For any new trends, provide: name, trigger, audience relevance, estimated lifespan, best platforms.
```

**Parameters**:
- `search_recency_filter`: `"week"` (default) or `"month"` (if fewer than 3 results)
- `search_context_size`: `"medium"`

**Source verification**: After getting trends, use `perplexity_search` to find 1-2 credible source URLs per trend (industry publications, platform data, research reports).

**Fallback**: If fewer than 3 trends found with `"week"` filter, retry with `"month"`.

**Output**: 3-5 validated trends with sources.

---

### Step 3: Brand Angle Conversion

**Goal**: Transform each raw trend into a brand-specific content angle.

For each trend from Step 2, apply the **positioning lens**:

1. **Connection point**: How does this trend relate to our brand's core positioning?
2. **Audience hook**: What aspect of this trend would our target audience care about most?
3. **Brand voice fit**: How would we talk about this in our brand's tone? (reference `voice-profile.md`)
4. **Angle statement**: Write a one-sentence content direction that a copywriter could run with

**Urgency tagging** — assign one label per trend:

| Tag | Meaning | Action Window |
|-----|---------|---------------|
| 🔴 High | Time-sensitive, ride it NOW | Within 1 week |
| 🟡 Medium | Relevant window open | 2-4 weeks |
| 🟢 Low | Slow-burn, long shelf life | 1-2 months |

**Platform mapping** — for each angle, identify the 1-2 best platforms based on:
- Where the trend is most active
- Where the brand's audience is most engaged
- Which format best suits the angle (long-form → LinkedIn, visual → Instagram, etc.)

**Output**: 3-5 trend angles with urgency tags and platform recommendations.

---

### Step 4: Evergreen Angles

**Goal**: Add 2-3 timeless content angles derived from brand positioning.

Evergreen angles are NOT trend-dependent. They come from:
- The brand's core value proposition
- Recurring audience pain points (from `positioning.md` or `research-memory/`)
- Category fundamentals that never go out of style

For each evergreen angle, define:
- **Theme**: The broad topic area
- **Brand angle**: The brand's unique perspective on this theme
- **Best platforms**: Where this type of content performs best
- **Reuse cadence**: How often this angle can be recycled (weekly, monthly, quarterly)

**For Refresh mode**: Keep existing evergreen angles intact. Only add new ones if a clear gap is identified. Never delete existing evergreen angles — they are stable by design.

**Output**: 2-3 evergreen angles appended after current trends.

---

### Step 5: Save & Log

**Goal**: Write all findings to `creative-memory/trend-angles.md` and log the execution.

#### 5a. Write trend-angles.md

Use the exact schema below:

```markdown
# Trend Angles
> Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
> Source skill: trend-scout
> Mode: [Full Scan / Refresh]

## Current Trends
| # | Trend | Brand Angle | Urgency | Best Platforms |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | [trend name] | [brand-specific angle statement] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 | [platform list] |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Evergreen Angles
| # | Theme | Brand Angle | Best Platforms | Reuse Cadence |
|---|-------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | [theme] | [brand-specific angle] | [platforms] | [weekly/monthly/quarterly] |

## Sources
| Trend | Source URL | Retrieved |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| [trend name] | [URL] | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
```

**For Refresh mode**: Do NOT overwrite the entire file. Update the Current Trends table (replace stale trends, add new ones). Keep Evergreen Angles section intact unless explicitly adding new ones. Append `> Refreshed: [date]` below the header.

#### 5b. Update creative-log.md

Append one row:

```
| [YYYY-MM-DD] | trend-scout | Full Scan / Refresh | [brief summary: e.g., "Found 4 trends: AI content tools, micro-communities, ..."] | Perplexity |
```

## Perplexity MCP Tool Guide

| Tool | When to Use | This Skill |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `perplexity_ask` | Fast Q&A, current trends, factual | Step 2 main discovery |
| `perplexity_search` | Find specific URLs, verify sources | Step 2 source verification |

**Common parameters**:
- `search_recency_filter`: `"week"` for trends (default), `"month"` if results are sparse
- `search_context_size`: `"medium"` — trends need current data but not deep analysis

**Query best practices**:
- Always include the exact brand category in every query
- Specify "for social media content" to get actionable trends (not just news)
- Ask for estimated trend lifespan — crucial for urgency tagging
- One discovery query + one verification query per run (minimize API calls)
- For Refresh: provide existing trend list so Perplexity can identify what's new vs. stale

---

## Memory Access Rules

| Memory | Permission | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `brand-memory/positioning.md` | **Read-only** | Core lens for trend → angle conversion |
| `brand-memory/voice-profile.md` | **Read-only** | Tone consistency for angle framing |
| `research-memory/market-landscape.md` | **Read-only** | Market context, seasonality awareness |
| `creative-memory/trend-angles.md` | **Read & Write** | Primary output file |
| `creative-memory/creative-log.md` | **Write (append)** | Execution history |

**NEVER write to brand-memory/ or research-memory/.** These are owned by vibe-mkt and mkt-study respectively.

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Perplexity MCP unavailable | Inform user → generate evergreen angles only from positioning.md |
| `positioning.md` not found | Ask user directly for brand category + positioning → proceed |
| Fewer than 3 trends found | Expand: widen recency filter from `"week"` → `"month"`, broaden category keywords |
| Existing `trend-angles.md` unparseable | Suggest Full Scan mode to rebuild from scratch |
| Source verification returns no URLs | Keep the trend but mark source as "Perplexity synthesis (no direct URL)" |

---

## Quality Checklist

Before saving, verify:

- [ ] At least 3 current trends identified with brand angles
- [ ] Every trend has an urgency tag (🔴/🟡/🟢) and platform recommendation
- [ ] At least 2 evergreen angles included
- [ ] All angles are filtered through brand positioning (not generic trend descriptions)
- [ ] Sources section has at least 1 URL per trend (or explicit "no direct URL" note)
- [ ] `creative-log.md` updated with execution record
- [ ] brand-memory/ was read-only (no writes)
- [ ] For Refresh: existing evergreen angles preserved, only stale trends replaced

---

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- **Write social posts** → Use `post-writer` (consumes this output)
- **Plan campaigns** → Use `series-planner` (consumes this output)
- **Generate images** → Use `image-creator` (downstream)
- **Deep market research** → Use `market-scanner` from mkt-study plugin
- **Competitor analysis** → Use `competitor-analyzer` from mkt-study plugin

Trend Scout stays focused on **discovering trends and converting them into brand content angles** — nothing more.
