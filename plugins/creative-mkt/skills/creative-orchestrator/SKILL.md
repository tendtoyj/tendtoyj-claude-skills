# Creative Orchestrator

> Diagnose your creative status, build the optimal skill chain, and guide execution step by step.
> No external tools — pure routing. Reads `creative-memory/` to recommend what to run and when.

---

## Purpose

Creative Orchestrator is the **traffic controller** for all 6 creative skills. It answers:

- What creative assets do I have, and what's missing?
- Which skill should I run next?
- In what order should I chain skills for my goal?
- What's stale and needs refreshing?

This skill **never creates content itself**. It reads `creative-memory/` to diagnose the current state, analyzes the user's request, and produces a step-by-step execution plan pointing to the right skills.

---

## Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **A: Full Pipeline** | New brand, empty creative-memory/ | Chain all skills: Foundation → Research → Content → Visual |
| **B: Content Sprint** | Foundation complete, need to produce content | Skip foundation, go straight to content + visuals |
| **C: Single Skill** | Specific task only | Route to one skill (with prerequisite check) |
| **D: Refresh** | Existing data is outdated | Re-run stale skills in Update/Refresh mode |

---

## Auto-Load Protocol

On every invocation, BEFORE any routing:

1. **Check `creative-memory/` directory**
   - If missing → Create from `creative-memory-template/`
2. **Read ALL `.md` files in `creative-memory/`** (except README.md)
3. For each file, assess:
   - **Exists?** — File present with substantive content (not just scaffold placeholders)
   - **Last updated** — Extract date from `> Last updated:` header or `creative-log.md`
   - **Richness** — Rich (detailed data) / Thin (scaffold only)
4. **Read `creative-log.md`** → Extract last execution date per skill
5. **Check `brand-memory/`** (read-only) → `voice-profile.md` + `positioning.md` availability
6. **Optionally check `research-memory/`** (read-only) → Market context availability
7. **Build Creative Status Dashboard** (see Step 1)

---

## Process

### Step 1: Build Creative Status Dashboard

Generate this dashboard from the Auto-Load data:

```
Creative Status Dashboard
══════════════════════════
🎨 Visual Guidelines       : [STATUS] [DATE_INFO]
📖 Storytelling Frameworks  : [STATUS] [DATE_INFO]
📈 Trend Angles             : [STATUS] [DATE_INFO] [FRESHNESS]
📝 Content Examples         : [STATUS] [ENTRY_COUNT]
📋 Creative Log             : [LAST_ENTRY_DATE]

External Context:
🔤 Brand Voice (brand-memory)      : [AVAILABLE / MISSING]
🎯 Positioning (brand-memory)      : [AVAILABLE / MISSING]
📊 Market Trends (research-memory) : [AVAILABLE / MISSING]
```

**Status values**:

- `✅ Complete` — File exists with substantive content
- `⚠️ Stale (Xd)` — Complete but outdated (see thresholds below)
- `❌ Missing` — File doesn't exist or is empty scaffold

**Staleness thresholds** (file-specific):

| File | Recommend | Strongly Recommend | Re-build |
|------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| trend-angles.md | 7+ days | 14+ days | 30+ days |
| visual-guidelines.md | 30+ days | 90+ days | 180+ days |
| storytelling-frameworks.md | 30+ days | 90+ days | 180+ days |
| content-examples.md | Never stale | — | — |

**Always show the dashboard first** — it grounds the conversation in facts, not assumptions.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Request + Select Mode

Match the user's request to the right mode:

| Condition | Auto-Suggest |
|-----------|-------------|
| creative-memory/ empty + broad request ("만들어줘", "처음부터") | **Mode A: Full Pipeline** |
| creative-memory/ empty + specific skill mentioned | **Mode C: Single Skill** (but recommend Full Pipeline) |
| Foundation ✅ complete + content request | **Mode B: Content Sprint** |
| Foundation ✅ complete + specific skill needed | **Mode C: Single Skill** |
| creative-memory/ has data + "업데이트/갱신/리프레시" | **Mode D: Refresh** |
| Ambiguous request | Show dashboard → ask user to pick a mode |

**"Foundation complete"** = both `visual-guidelines.md` AND `storytelling-frameworks.md` have substantive content.

Present the suggested mode with a one-line rationale. Let the user confirm or override.

---

### Step 3: Build Execution Path

#### Skill Dependency Map

```
Group 1 — Foundation (sequential)
  visual-extractor ──→ framework-builder
    → visual-guidelines.md    → storytelling-frameworks.md

Group 2 — Research (independent, but benefits from Group 1)
  trend-scout
    → trend-angles.md

Group 3 — Content (requires Group 1 + 2)
  post-writer            OR    series-planner → post-writer × N
    → posts/[file].md            → campaigns/[file].md + posts × N

Group 4 — Visual (requires Group 3 output)
  image-creator × N
    → image files
```

Groups 1 and 2 are independent — user can choose the starting group.
Groups 3 and 4 must wait for upstream groups.

#### Mode A: Full Pipeline Path

```
📋 Full Creative Pipeline
══════════════════════════
Group 1 — Foundation
  Step 1: visual-extractor   → visual-guidelines.md
  Step 2: framework-builder  → storytelling-frameworks.md

Group 2 — Research
  Step 3: trend-scout        → trend-angles.md

Group 3 — Content
  Step 4: post-writer OR series-planner → post files

Group 4 — Visual
  Step 5: image-creator      → brand visuals

💡 Groups 1 & 2 are independent. Which group first?
```

#### Mode B: Content Sprint Path

Two sub-paths based on scope:

| User Request | Path |
|-------------|------|
| Single post ("포스트 하나") | post-writer → image-creator |
| Trend-based post ("트렌드 콘텐츠") | trend-scout → post-writer → image-creator |
| Campaign/series ("7일 캠페인") | series-planner → post-writer × N → image-creator × N |
| Trend + campaign | trend-scout → series-planner → post-writer × N → image-creator × N |

If `trend-angles.md` is stale (7+ days), recommend running trend-scout first regardless of sub-path.

#### Mode C: Single Skill Path

1. Map user request → target skill using this table:

| User Request Pattern | Target Skill | Prerequisite |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Visual guidelines, brand colors, typography | visual-extractor | None (needs image uploads) |
| Storytelling frameworks, narrative patterns | framework-builder | visual-extractor recommended |
| Trends, what's hot, trend angles | trend-scout | None |
| Write a post, social copy, caption | post-writer | guidelines + frameworks recommended |
| Campaign plan, series, multi-day content | series-planner | frameworks recommended |
| Image, visual, generate picture | image-creator | visual-guidelines recommended + copy needed |

2. Check prerequisites against dashboard status
3. If prerequisite missing → include it in the path with explanation
4. Present the path

#### Mode D: Refresh Path

1. Read `creative-log.md` → calculate days since last run per skill
2. Identify stale files using the threshold table from Step 1
3. Build refresh path — stale skills only, in dependency order
4. **Cascade rule**: If a Foundation file refreshes, flag downstream impact:
   - visual-guidelines refreshed → image-creator will use updated style on next run
   - frameworks refreshed → post-writer/series-planner will use updated patterns
   - trend-angles refreshed → new angles available for post-writer

---

### Step 4: Guide Execution

#### Initial handoff:

```
▶ Next skill: [SKILL_NAME]
  Purpose: [one-line description]
  Input needed: [what the user should prepare]

Say "[SKILL_NAME] 실행해줘" to start.
```

#### After each skill completes:

```
✅ [COMPLETED_SKILL] done → [output_file] saved

▶ Next: [NEXT_SKILL_NAME]
  Purpose: [one-line description]

Continue? Say "[NEXT_SKILL_NAME] 실행해줘"
```

#### After all skills complete:

Summarize what was built + suggest next options: create more posts, expand to another platform, plan a campaign series, or atomize for distribution via vibe-mkt's content-atomizer.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- **Create content** → Use the individual skills (post-writer, image-creator, etc.)
- **Write to creative-memory/** → Each skill writes its own output; this skill only reads
- **Execute marketing** → Use vibe-mkt for text marketing assets
- **Conduct research** → Use mkt-study for market/competitor research

Creative Orchestrator stays focused on **routing** — diagnosing what's needed, building the path, and guiding execution.
