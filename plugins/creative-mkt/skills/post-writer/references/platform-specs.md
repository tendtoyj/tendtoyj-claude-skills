# Platform Specs — Post Writer Reference

Detailed format specifications for each platform. Post-writer reads this during Step 2 (copy writing) and Step 3 (visual direction) to ensure every post meets platform-native standards.

---

## 1. LinkedIn

### Formats

**Long-form Post** (primary, most versatile)
- Character limit: 3,000
- Sweet spot: ≤1,300 characters (the "see more" fold — everything above it must hook the reader)
- Structure:
  ```
  [Hook — one punchy line that earns the "see more" click]
  ↵
  [Context — 2-3 short paragraphs, 1-2 sentences each]
  ↵
  [Insight — the "so what" moment]
  ↵
  [CTA — question that invites comments, or direct ask]
  ↵
  #Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3
  ```
- The first line carries the entire post. It must work on its own — no dependent clause, no "I was thinking about..." warmup.
- Short paragraphs with line breaks between them. Walls of text die on LinkedIn.
- Tone: professional but human. Personal stories and lessons outperform corporate announcements.

**Carousel** (slide-based, PDF upload)
- Slides: 8-10
- Per slide: 100-150 characters (must be readable at a glance on mobile)
- Structure:
  - Slide 1: Hook title — bold, attention-grabbing, treat it like a magazine cover
  - Slides 2-3: Problem setup or context
  - Slides 4-8: Core content, one idea per slide
  - Final slide: CTA ("Follow for more" / "Save this" / "Link in comments")
- Each slide needs visual direction (background color, text placement, icon/illustration suggestion).

**Poll**
- Question derived from the topic (should split opinion, avoid obvious answers)
- 3-4 options
- Supporting text below: 1-2 sentences explaining why this matters
- Polls drive comments — the question should invite people to explain their choice

### Hashtag Strategy
- Count: 3-5
- Mix: 2 industry-specific + 1-2 trending + 1 branded (if applicable)
- Place at the end of the post, separated by a line break

### CTA Patterns
- Engagement: "What's your experience with this?" / "Agree or disagree?"
- Lead capture: "Link in comments" / "DM me [keyword] for the free [resource]"
- Community: "Tag someone who needs to see this"

### Tone Calibration
- Voice retention: 100% brand voice
- Professional expression of brand personality — authority without stuffiness

### Visual Specs
- Post image: 1200×627 px (1.91:1)
- Carousel slides: 1080×1080 px (square) or 1080×1350 px (portrait, recommended)

## 2. Twitter / X

### Formats

**Thread** (primary for depth)
- Tweet count: 5-12
- Character limit per tweet: 280
- Structure:
  ```
  Tweet 1: [Hook — the entire pitch, works standalone] 🧵
  Tweet 2: [Context — why this matters]
  Tweets 3-N: [One point per tweet, each stands alone]
  Final tweet: [CTA + ask for retweet of tweet 1]
  ```
- Tweet 1 is everything. If someone only reads one tweet, it should deliver value or create enough curiosity to pull them in.
- Each tweet must be retweetable on its own — no "And another thing..." that depends on the previous tweet for meaning.
- Use line breaks for emphasis within a tweet, not walls of text.
- Tone: concise, punchy, strong opening words. No fluff, no filler.

**Single Tweet**
- Character limit: 280
- Sweet spot: 240-270 (leave room for engagement)
- Use for: the sharpest Data or Bold Claim hook from your topic
- Numbers, contrast, and specificity outperform vague statements
- Pattern options:
  - "[Surprising stat]. Here's what nobody talks about:"
  - "Unpopular opinion: [contrarian reframe]"
  - "[Concrete result]. No [trendy tactic]. Just [boring fundamental]."

### Hashtag Strategy
- Count: 0-1
- Hashtags reduce engagement on X. Use sparingly or skip entirely.
- If using one, make it a branded tag only.

### CTA Patterns
- Engagement: "What would you add?" / "Hot take — change my mind"
- Thread close: "If this was useful, RT tweet 1 so others find it"
- Lead capture: "DM me [keyword] for the [resource]"

### Tone Calibration
- Voice retention: 90%
- +10% more direct, witty, compressed
- Twitter/X rewards confidence and brevity. The same insight that takes 3 paragraphs on LinkedIn should take 2 sentences here.

### Visual Specs
- Image: 1600×900 px (16:9)
- Thread visuals: optional, one image per key tweet can boost engagement

---

## 3. Instagram

### Formats

**Carousel** (primary for education/value)
- Slides: 10 (use all 10 — Instagram's algorithm rewards full carousel swipes)
- Per slide: concise text, visual-first
- Structure:
  - Slide 1: Hook — treat like a magazine cover. Bold, one statement.
  - Slides 2-9: Content — one idea per slide, larger text, heavy visual emphasis
  - Slide 10: CTA — "Save this for later" / "Share with someone who needs this" / "Follow @handle"
- Caption: brief context + CTA. Under 150 chars for feed display (full caption truncated).
- Visual direction is critical — Instagram is a visual platform first. Every slide needs specific design guidance.

**Reel Script** (primary for stories/demos)
- Duration: 30-60 seconds (sweet spot)
- Structure:
  ```
  [0-3 sec]  HOOK — attention-grabbing statement or question
             Visual: fast cut, text overlay, direct to camera
  [3-15 sec] SETUP — context, "here's the thing..."
             Visual: talking head or B-roll
  [15-45 sec] VALUE — core content delivery
             Visual: B-roll, screen recording, text callouts
  [45-60 sec] CTA — "Follow for more" / "Comment your answer"
             Visual: logo, text overlay CTA
  ```
- First 3 seconds decide everything. If the hook doesn't stop the scroll in 3 seconds, the rest doesn't matter.
- Text overlay on every key point — many viewers watch without sound.
- Cross-postable to YouTube Shorts (design for both).

**Story Series**
- Frames: 3-5
- Duration per frame: 15 seconds
- Tone: casual, behind-the-scenes, conversational
- Interactive elements on each frame: polls, quizzes, question stickers, emoji sliders
- Progression: Tease → Reveal → Engage → CTA
- Last frame: Link sticker or "DM me" CTA

### Hashtag Strategy
- Count: 5-15
- Placement: first comment (preferred) or at caption end
- Mix: niche-specific + broad discovery + branded

### CTA Patterns
- Save: "Save this for later" (saves boost algorithm ranking)
- Share: "Send this to someone who needs it"
- Engage: "Tag someone" / "What's your answer? 👇"
- Lead capture: "Link in bio" (update bio link to current lead magnet)

### Tone Calibration
- Voice retention: 80%
- +20% more accessible, visual-first language
- Shorter sentences, more casual phrasing. The same brand personality, adapted to a platform where people scroll fast and feel things quickly.

### Visual Specs
- Feed post: 1080×1080 px (square)
- Carousel: 1080×1350 px (portrait, recommended for more real estate)
- Reel/Story: 1080×1920 px (9:16 vertical)

## 4. YouTube

### Formats

**Full Script** (long-form)
- Duration: 5-15 minutes (algorithm sweet spot: 8-12 min)
- Structure:
  ```
  [0:00-0:30]  HOOK — "In this video, I'll show you [specific result]"
                Promise a concrete outcome in the first 30 seconds.
  [0:30-1:00]  INTRO — brief context, what to expect, why it matters
  [1:00-X:00]  BODY — 3-5 sections, each with a clear [TIMESTAMP] marker
  [X:00-end]   CTA — subscribe, like, next video recommendation
  ```
- Each section marked with `[TIMESTAMP]` for chapter markers in the description.
- Tone: educational + energetic, not robotic. Conversational authority.
- Pattern-interrupt every 2-3 minutes (question, visual change, tone shift) to maintain retention.

**Shorts Script** (vertical short-form)
- Duration: <60 seconds (sweet spot: 30-45 sec)
- Structure:
  ```
  [0-5 sec]   HOOK — strongest single hook, text overlay
  [5-50 sec]  CONTENT — rapid delivery, one core insight
  [50-60 sec] CTA — "Follow for part 2" / "Comment your take"
  ```
- One idea only. Resist the urge to cram everything in.
- Designed to cross-post to Instagram Reels.
- Text overlay every key point.

### CTA Patterns
- "Subscribe if this was useful"
- "Comment your biggest takeaway"
- "Link in description" + pinned comment with resource URL

### Tone Calibration
- Voice retention: 90%
- +10% more educational, energetic
- YouTube viewers chose to click — they're more invested than scroll-by platforms. Reward that investment with depth.

### Visual Specs
- Thumbnail: 1280×720 px (16:9, high contrast, readable at small size)
- Shorts: 1080×1920 px (9:16 vertical)

## 5. Email

### Formats

**Newsletter Section** (standalone value piece)
- Length: 300-500 words
- Structure:
  ```
  Subject line: [hook — must earn the open]
  Preview text: [first 40-90 chars visible in inbox]
  ---
  [Hook intro — personal, conversational]
  [Body — the insight, story, or lesson]
  [CTA — "Read the full article →" or "Reply and tell me what you think"]
  ```
- Written to drop into a newsletter as one self-contained section.
- Tone: the most personal channel. Write like talking to one person who happens to be a customer.
- "Hit reply" is the single most powerful email CTA — it signals to ESP algorithms that the reader is engaged.

**Nurture Content** (short value-add for sequences)
- Length: 75-150 words
- Structure:
  ```
  [One hook — grab attention quickly]
  [One insight — teach something in 2-3 sentences]
  [One bridge — connect to the next email or a resource]
  [Soft CTA — not a sell, a teaching moment]
  ```
- Works as the VALUE email in a welcome sequence or drip campaign.
- Light and useful. The reader should feel they gained something, not that they were sold to.

### CTA Patterns
- Engagement: "Hit reply and tell me..." (reply rate = deliverability signal)
- Content: "Read the full article →"
- Resource: "Grab the free [resource] →"
- Conversion: "See how [product] handles this →" (soft, curiosity-based)

### Tone Calibration
- Voice retention: 100%
- Most personal expression of the brand. Email is a conversation, not a broadcast.
- First-person, direct address. "I" and "you", not "we" and "our customers."

### Visual Specs
- Header image (optional): 600×200 px
- Inline images: 600px wide max
- Keep images minimal — email is a text-first medium. One header image at most.
