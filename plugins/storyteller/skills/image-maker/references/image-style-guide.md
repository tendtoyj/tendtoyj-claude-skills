## 카드 타입별 구도 서픽스

스타일 프리픽스 뒤, 장면 설명 뒤에 붙여 구도를 제어한다.

### tpl-a-cover (템플릿 A 표지)

```
Full-frame composition. Use a slightly elevated camera angle so the main subject sits naturally in the upper portion of the frame. The scene should extend continuously — floor, surface, or environment receding toward the bottom — rather than cutting off abruptly. Upper area bright and detailed; lower area may darken or soften naturally. Eye-catching hero visual that works as a cover image.
```

### tpl-a-content (템플릿 A 내용)

```
Full-frame composition. Use a slightly elevated camera angle to place the main subject above center. The background and surface should continue naturally below the subject, creating a smooth visual flow from top to bottom. The image serves as a background for overlaid text. Keep the overall visual balanced and not overly complex, allowing text to remain legible.
```

### tpl-b-cover (템플릿 B 표지)

```
Full-frame composition. Use a slightly elevated or bird's-eye camera angle so the main subject naturally occupies the upper portion of the frame. The scene should continue below — a receding surface, ground plane, or environment extending toward the bottom edge — keeping the lower area visually calm but not artificially empty. The visual weight and focal point should sit in the upper half of the image.
```

### tpl-b-content (템플릿 B 내용)

```
Composition optimized for top-crop display (top ~70% visible). Use a slightly elevated camera angle so the main subject sits in the upper portion of the frame. Let the scene's surface or environment continue naturally below, providing breathing room under the subject. The bottom portion may be cropped without losing the composition.
```
