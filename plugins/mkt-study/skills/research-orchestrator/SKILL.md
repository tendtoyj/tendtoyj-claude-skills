# Research Orchestrator

> Diagnose your research needs, build the optimal skill chain, and guide execution step by step.
> No external tools — pure routing. Reads `research-memory/` status to recommend what to run and when.

---

## Purpose

Research Orchestrator is the **traffic controller** for all 8 research skills. It answers:
- What research do I need right now?
- What's already done, and what's missing?
- In what order should I run the skills?
- What's stale and needs refreshing?

This skill **never conducts research itself**. It reads `research-memory/` to diagnose the current state, analyzes the user's request, and produces a step-by-step execution plan pointing to the right skills.

> "Doing research without a plan is like shopping without a list — you'll miss what matters and waste time on what doesn't."

---

## Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **A: Full Research** | New brand/product, empty research-memory/ | Chain all 8 skills in dependency order |
| **B: Focused Research** | Specific question or area needed | Select 1-3 skills based on request |
| **C: Refresh** | Existing research is outdated | Re-run stale skills in Refresh mode |
| **D: Validate** | Strategy brief exists, need expert check | Run expert-validator only |

---

## Auto-Load Protocol

On every invocation, BEFORE any routing:

1. **Check `research-memory/` directory**
2. If files exist → Read ALL `.md` files (except README.md)
3. For each file, assess:
   - **Exists?** — File present with substantive content (not just scaffold headers)
   - **Last updated** — Extract date from `> Last updated:` header or `research-log.md`
   - **Richness** — Rich (detailed data) / Adequate / Thin (scaffold only)
   - **Enrichment status** — For `competitive-intel.md`: which skills have contributed? (`[competitor-finder]` / `[competitor-analyzer]` / `[competitor-visual]`)
   - **Expert validation** — For `strategy-brief.md`: are `[expert-validator]` sections populated?
4. Read `research-log.md` → Extract last execution date per skill
5. **Check `brand-memory/`** (read-only) → If exists, use business context to pre-fill recommendations
6. **Build Status Dashboard** (see Step 1 below)

---

## Process

### Step 1: Build Status Dashboard

**Goal**: Show the user exactly where their research stands.

Generate this dashboard from the Auto-Load data:

```
Research Status Dashboard
══════════════════════════
📊 Market Landscape    : [STATUS] [DATE_INFO]
🏢 Competitive Intel   : [STATUS] [DATE_INFO] [ENRICHMENT_INFO]
👥 Customer Insight    : [STATUS] [DATE_INFO]
💬 Customer Language   : [STATUS] [DATE_INFO]
📋 Strategy Brief      : [STATUS] [DATE_INFO] [VALIDATION_INFO]
📝 Research Log        : [LAST_ENTRY_DATE]
```

**Status values**:
- `✅ Complete` — File exists with substantive content
- `⚠️ Stale (Xd ago)` — Complete but outdated (30+ days)
- `⚠️ Partial` — File exists but missing sections (e.g., competitive-intel with finder only)
- `❌ Missing` — File doesn't exist or is empty scaffold

**Staleness thresholds**:
- 30+ days → "Update recommended"
- 90+ days → "Update strongly recommended"
- 180+ days → "Re-research needed"

**Always show the dashboard first** — it grounds the conversation in facts, not assumptions.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Request + Select Mode

**Goal**: Match the user's request to the right mode.

| Condition | Auto-Suggest |
|-----------|-------------|
| research-memory/ empty or missing + broad request | **Mode A: Full Research** |
| research-memory/ empty + specific area mentioned | **Mode B: Focused** (but recommend Full) |
| research-memory/ has data + specific area mentioned | **Mode B: Focused** |
| research-memory/ has data + "update"/"refresh"/"renew" | **Mode C: Refresh** |
| strategy-brief.md exists + "validate"/"review"/"check" | **Mode D: Validate** |
| Ambiguous request | Show dashboard → ask user to choose |

Present the suggested mode with a one-line rationale. Let the user confirm or override.

---

### Step 3: Build Execution Path

**Goal**: Generate the ordered list of skills to run, respecting dependencies.

#### Skill Dependency Map

```
market-scanner ─────────────────────────────────────┐
  → market-landscape.md                              │
                                                     │
competitor-finder ──┬── competitor-analyzer           │
  → competitive-    │     → enriches messaging/CTA   ├─→ research-synthesizer
     intel.md       │                                │      → strategy-brief.md
     (skeleton)     └── competitor-visual             │           │
                          → enriches design/visual    │           ▼
                                                     │    expert-validator
audience-profiler ──── voice-of-customer             │      → enriches strategy
  → customer-           → customer-language.md       │         -brief.md
     insight.md                                      │
                                                     │
                    ────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Group independence** (for Mode A):
- Group 1 (Market): `market-scanner` — no prerequisites
- Group 2 (Competition): `competitor-finder` → `competitor-analyzer` → `competitor-visual` — sequential chain
- Group 3 (Customer): `audience-profiler` → `voice-of-customer` — sequential chain
- Group 4 (Synthesis): `research-synthesizer` → `expert-validator` — requires Groups 1+2+3

Groups 1, 2, 3 are independent of each other — user can choose the starting group.

#### Mode A: Full Research Path

Present the complete chain:

```
📋 Full Research Plan
═════════════════════
Group 1 — Market
  Step 1: market-scanner → market-landscape.md

Group 2 — Competition
  Step 2: competitor-finder → competitive-intel.md (skeleton)
  Step 3: competitor-analyzer → competitive-intel.md (+messaging)
  Step 4: competitor-visual → competitive-intel.md (+design)

Group 3 — Customer
  Step 5: audience-profiler → customer-insight.md
  Step 6: voice-of-customer → customer-language.md

Group 4 — Synthesis (after Groups 1-3)
  Step 7: research-synthesizer → strategy-brief.md
  Step 8: expert-validator → strategy-brief.md (+expert review)

💡 Groups 1-3 are independent. Which group would you like to start with?
```

#### Mode B: Focused Research Path

1. Map user request to target skill(s) using this table:

| User Request Pattern | Target Skill | Prerequisite |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Market size, trends, structure | market-scanner | None |
| Find competitors, competitive set | competitor-finder | None |
| Competitor website, messaging, pricing | competitor-analyzer | competitor-finder ✅ |
| Competitor design, visual, screenshots | competitor-visual | competitor-finder ✅ |
| Target audience, segments, journey | audience-profiler | None |
| Customer language, reviews, community | voice-of-customer | audience-profiler recommended |
| Strategy brief, cross-analysis, synthesis | research-synthesizer | market-scanner + competitor-finder + audience-profiler ✅ |
| Expert review, validate strategy | expert-validator | research-synthesizer ✅ |

2. Check prerequisites against dashboard status
3. If prerequisite missing → include it in the path
4. Present the focused path

#### Mode C: Refresh Path

1. Read `research-log.md` → calculate days since last run per skill
2. Identify stale skills (30/90/180-day thresholds)
3. Build refresh path — stale skills only, in dependency order
4. **Cascade rule**: If a data-producing skill refreshes, downstream synthesis may need refresh too:
   - market-landscape refreshed → flag research-synthesizer for refresh
   - competitive-intel refreshed → flag research-synthesizer for refresh
   - customer-insight refreshed → flag voice-of-customer + research-synthesizer for refresh

#### Mode D: Validate Path

1. Check `strategy-brief.md` exists with content
2. If YES → direct to `expert-validator`
3. If NO → explain prerequisite chain: `research-synthesizer` first (and its prerequisites if missing)

---

### Step 4: Guide Execution

**Goal**: Hand off to the first skill and provide ongoing navigation.

> **Language**: 사용자가 언어를 지정하면 대시보드 및 안내 텍스트를 해당 언어로 출력합니다. 개별 스킬 호출 시 동일한 언어 설정을 전달합니다.

#### Initial handoff:

```
▶ Next skill: [SKILL_NAME]
  Purpose: [one-line description]
  Input needed: [what the user should prepare]

Say "[SKILL_NAME] 실행해줘" to start.
```

#### After each skill completes:

Provide a transition prompt:

```
✅ [COMPLETED_SKILL] done → [output_file] saved

▶ Next: [NEXT_SKILL_NAME]
  Purpose: [one-line description]

Continue? Say "[NEXT_SKILL_NAME] 실행해줘"
```

#### After all research skills complete:

If `strategy-brief.md` exists with Next Steps → bridge to marketing execution:

```
🎯 Research complete! Your strategy brief recommends:
  1. [Next Step 1] → [marketing skill name]
  2. [Next Step 2] → [marketing skill name]
  3. [Next Step 3] → [marketing skill name]

Ready to execute? Pick a next step to start.
```

## Quality Checklist

Before presenting a research plan, verify:

- [ ] Status Dashboard shown with accurate file states and dates
- [ ] Mode selection has clear rationale tied to dashboard state + user request
- [ ] Execution path respects all skill dependencies (no skill runs before its prerequisite)
- [ ] Each step in the path names the skill, its output, and what the user needs to provide
- [ ] Focused mode includes missing prerequisites in the path
- [ ] Refresh mode uses staleness thresholds consistently (30/90/180 days)
- [ ] Refresh cascade logic applied (upstream refresh → downstream re-synthesis flagged)
- [ ] Post-completion bridge to marketing execution skills (when strategy-brief.md has Next Steps)

## Example: Full Research (Abbreviated)

**User**: "우리 브랜드 리서치를 처음부터 해야 하는데"

> **Dashboard**:
> 📊 Market Landscape: ❌ Missing · 🏢 Competitive Intel: ❌ Missing · 👥 Customer Insight: ❌ Missing · 💬 Customer Language: ❌ Missing · 📋 Strategy Brief: ❌ Missing
>
> **Mode**: A — Full Research (research-memory/ is empty)
>
> **Plan**: market-scanner → competitor-finder → competitor-analyzer → competitor-visual → audience-profiler → voice-of-customer → research-synthesizer → expert-validator
>
> **Next**: market-scanner — "비즈니스/제품 설명을 알려주시면 시작합니다."

---

## Example: Focused Research (Abbreviated)

**User**: "경쟁사 웹사이트 메시징을 좀 더 깊게 분석해줘"

> **Dashboard**:
> 📊 Market Landscape: ✅ Complete (2025-01-15) · 🏢 Competitive Intel: ✅ Complete (2025-01-12) · ...
>
> **Mode**: B — Focused (competitor-analyzer targets website messaging)
> **Prerequisite**: competitor-finder ✅ already complete
>
> **Plan**: competitor-analyzer only
> **Post-completion**: "competitive-intel.md가 업데이트되었습니다. research-synthesizer로 전략 브리프도 갱신할까요?"

---

## Example: Refresh (Abbreviated)

**User**: "3개월 전 리서치인데 업데이트 필요해"

> **Dashboard**:
> 📊 Market Landscape: ⚠️ Stale (95d) · 🏢 Competitive Intel: ⚠️ Stale (92d) · 👥 Customer Insight: ⚠️ Stale (90d) · 💬 Customer Language: ✅ 45d · 📋 Strategy Brief: ⚠️ Stale (88d)
>
> **Mode**: C — Refresh (3 files exceed 90-day threshold)
> **Plan**: market-scanner (Refresh) → competitor-finder (Refresh) → audience-profiler (Refresh) → research-synthesizer (Refresh)
> **Cascade**: Strategy brief refresh needed because 3 upstream sources refreshed.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- **Conduct research** → Use the individual research skills (market-scanner, competitor-finder, etc.)
- **Write to research-memory/** → Each skill writes its own output; this skill only reads
- **Execute marketing** → Use execution skills (brand-voice, copy, SEO, email, etc.)
- **Replace skill selection judgment** → It recommends; the user decides

Research Orchestrator stays focused on **routing** — diagnosing what's needed, building the path, and guiding execution.
