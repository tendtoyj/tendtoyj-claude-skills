# Competitor Analyzer

> Scrape competitor websites to extract real messaging, pricing, CTAs, and social proof.
> Uses Firecrawl for direct web data extraction. Enriches `competitive-intel.md` with actual website data.

---

## Purpose

Competitor Analyzer bridges the gap between **what we hear about competitors** and **what they actually say on their websites**.

- `competitor-finder` (Perplexity) answers: "Who are they and what's their general positioning?"
- **`competitor-analyzer` (Firecrawl) answers: "What exact words, prices, and proof do they put on their pages?"**

The output enriches `research-memory/competitive-intel.md` — adding `[competitor-analyzer]` tagged sections for website messaging detail, pricing intelligence, and cross-competitor patterns. This real data feeds downstream skills (brand-voice, direct-response-copy, positioning-angles) with **competitor language they can actually counter**.

---

## Prerequisite

**`competitor-finder` must have run first.** This skill reads `competitive-intel.md` to get the competitor list and URLs. If the file doesn't exist or has no URLs, stop and instruct the user to run `competitor-finder` first — or ask them to provide competitor URLs directly.

---

## Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Full Analysis** | First run, or `competitive-intel.md` has no `[competitor-analyzer]` sections yet | Scrape ALL competitors in the list |
| **Targeted** | User wants to analyze specific 1-3 competitors | Scrape only the named competitors |
| **Refresh** | `[competitor-analyzer]` sections exist and need updating | Check `research-log.md` for last analysis date → re-scrape and update |

---

## Auto-Load Protocol

On every invocation, BEFORE any scraping:

1. **Check `research-memory/` directory**
2. If files exist → Read ALL `.md` files (except README.md)
3. **Critical: Read `competitive-intel.md`** → Extract competitor names and URLs
   - If file missing → STOP. Tell user: "Run competitor-finder first, or provide competitor URLs."
   - If file exists but no URLs → Ask user to provide URLs directly
4. **Check `brand-memory/`** (read-only) → If exists, note our own positioning for comparison context
5. If `[competitor-analyzer]` sections already exist in `competitive-intel.md` → **suggest Refresh mode**
6. Show the competitor list to the user and confirm which to analyze

---

## Input Gathering

Collect conversationally. Most inputs come from `competitive-intel.md` — just confirm with the user.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Analysis mode | YES | Full / Targeted / Refresh |
| Competitor URLs | Conditional | Only if not in `competitive-intel.md` |
| Analysis focus | Optional | Specific area: pricing, messaging, CTAs, all |
| Our own URL | Optional | Enables direct comparison |

**If competitive-intel.md has URLs**, show the list and ask: "I found these competitors. Should I analyze all of them, or specific ones?"

**If this is a Refresh**, show the last analysis date and ask: "What's changed or what should I re-check?"

---

## Process

### Step 1: Build Scraping Plan

**Goal**: Determine which competitors and which pages to scrape.

Read `competitive-intel.md` → extract competitor list with URLs.

For each competitor, plan these pages (in priority order):
1. **Homepage** (required): hero messaging, value prop, CTA, social proof
2. **Pricing page** (required): plans, pricing model, free tier, enterprise
3. **Product/Features page** (optional): feature list, differentiator claims

**Finding pricing pages**: If the pricing URL isn't obvious (`/pricing`, `/plans`), use `firecrawl_map` to discover it:

```
firecrawl_map:
  url: "[competitor-homepage]"
  search: "pricing"
```

Present the scraping plan to the user for confirmation before proceeding.

---

### Step 2: Scrape Homepage Messaging

**Goal**: Extract every key messaging element from each competitor's homepage.

**Tool**: `firecrawl_scrape` with JSON format

For each competitor, use `firecrawl_scrape` with JSON format and the **Homepage Messaging Schema** (see `references/scraping-schemas.md` for full schema).

Key extraction fields: `hero_headline`, `sub_headline`, `value_proposition`, `target_audience_signals`, `cta_buttons`, `social_proof_logos`, `social_proof_testimonials`, `social_proof_metrics`, `tone_keywords`.

**If JSON extraction returns empty or minimal**: retry with `formats: ["markdown"]` and `onlyMainContent: true`, then parse manually.

**If the page requires JS rendering**: add `waitFor: 5000`.

Report progress to the user after each competitor: "Scraped [Competitor A] homepage. Moving to pricing page..."

---

### Step 3: Scrape Pricing Pages

**Goal**: Extract pricing structure, plans, and framing from each competitor.

**Tool**: `firecrawl_scrape` with JSON format and the **Pricing Page Schema** (see `references/scraping-schemas.md` for full schema).

Key extraction fields: `pricing_model`, `plans` (name, price_monthly, price_annual, key_features, limitations), `free_tier_details`, `enterprise_option`, `price_framing_tactics`.

**If no pricing page found**: note "Pricing not publicly available" — this itself is a data point (likely enterprise/sales-led model).

---

### Step 4: Cross-Competitor Analysis

**Goal**: Compare all scraped data to find patterns, positioning gaps, and opportunities.

This step uses NO MCP tools — it's pure analysis of the data collected in Steps 2-3.

Apply these frameworks:

**A. Messaging Matrix**

| Dimension | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Hero Headline | [verbatim] | [verbatim] | [verbatim] |
| Value Proposition | [summary] | [summary] | [summary] |
| Primary CTA | [verbatim] | [verbatim] | [verbatim] |
| Tone / Voice | [keywords] | [keywords] | [keywords] |
| Social Proof Type | [type] | [type] | [type] |
| Pricing Model | [model] | [model] | [model] |

**B. Value Proposition Comparison** (per competitor)

- **Promise**: What outcome do they promise?
- **Evidence**: How do they prove it? (data, testimonials, demos)
- **Mechanism**: How does their product deliver? (the "how it works")
- **Uniqueness**: What do they claim only they can do?

**C. Narrative Analysis** (per competitor)

- **Villain**: What enemy do they position against? (legacy tools, complexity, cost, status quo)
- **Hero**: Who is the hero? (customer, product, team)
- **Transformation**: What before → after do they promise?
- **Stakes**: What happens if you don't act?

**D. Gaps & Opportunities**

Look for:
- Messaging blind spots: claims NO competitor makes that customers care about
- Price gaps: underserved price tiers
- CTA weakness: unclear or generic calls to action
- Social proof gaps: types of proof nobody uses (e.g., ROI data, case studies)
- Tone uniformity: if everyone sounds the same, there's room to stand out

---

### Step 5: Save & Log

**Goal**: Write all findings to `competitive-intel.md` as enrichment and log the execution.

#### 5a. Enrich competitive-intel.md

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT delete or modify any `[competitor-finder]` or `[competitor-visual]` tagged sections. Only add/update `[competitor-analyzer]` sections.

Append or update these sections:

```markdown
## Website Messaging Detail  [competitor-analyzer]
> Last enriched: [YYYY-MM-DD]

### [Competitor Name]
- **URL**: [scraped URL]
- **Hero Headline**: "[exact text]"
- **Sub-headline**: "[exact text]"
- **Value Proposition**: [analysis]
- **Target Audience Signals**: [signals from copy]
- **Primary CTA**: "[button text]"  |  Secondary: "[button text]"
- **Social Proof**: [type + key content]
- **Tone**: [3-5 keywords]

[Repeat for each competitor]

## Pricing Intelligence  [competitor-analyzer]
> Last enriched: [YYYY-MM-DD]

| Competitor | Model | Lowest | Highest | Free Tier | Enterprise |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| [Name] | [type] | [price] | [price] | [Y/N] | [Y/N] |

### [Competitor Name] — Pricing Detail
[Plan structure, framing tactics, key differentiating features per tier]

[Repeat for each competitor]

## Messaging Patterns  [competitor-analyzer]
> Last enriched: [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Messaging Matrix
[Step 4-A table]

### Value Proposition Comparison
[Step 4-B findings per competitor]

### Narrative Analysis
[Step 4-C findings per competitor]

## Gaps & Opportunities  [competitor-analyzer]
> Last enriched: [YYYY-MM-DD]

[Step 4-D findings — append to any existing gaps from competitor-finder, do NOT delete them]
```

**For Refresh mode**: Update only the `[competitor-analyzer]` sections. Change `> Last enriched:` date. Never touch `[competitor-finder]` or `[competitor-visual]` content.

#### 5b. Update research-log.md

Append one row:

```
| [YYYY-MM-DD] | competitor-analyzer | Full/Targeted/Refresh | [# competitors analyzed + key pattern summary] | Firecrawl |
```

## Firecrawl Tool Guide

| Tool | When to Use | This Skill |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `firecrawl_scrape` | Single page structured extraction | **Primary tool** — homepage + pricing per competitor |
| `firecrawl_map` | Discover URLs on a site | Find pricing page URL when not at `/pricing` |
| `firecrawl_extract` | Multi-URL structured extraction | Alternative for 5+ competitors (batch mode) |

**Common settings**:
- `onlyMainContent`: Always `true` — strip navigation/footer noise
- `formats`: Prefer JSON with schema for structured extraction
- `waitFor`: Add `5000` if page content loads empty (JS-rendered SPAs)
- Fallback: If JSON returns empty → switch to `["markdown"]` format and parse manually

**Error handling**:
- 403/blocked → Skip competitor, log as "access restricted"
- Timeout → Retry once with `waitFor: 10000`
- Empty content → Try `firecrawl_map` to find alternative landing page URL
- All retries fail → Skip and note in output: "Could not scrape [URL] — [reason]"

---

## Quality Checklist

Before saving, verify:

- [ ] Hero headlines recorded **verbatim** (not paraphrased or translated)
- [ ] CTA button text recorded **exactly as shown** on the page
- [ ] Pricing includes currency, billing cycle, and scrape date
- [ ] Messaging Matrix includes at least 3 competitors
- [ ] All `[competitor-analyzer]` sections have `> Last enriched:` date
- [ ] Existing `[competitor-finder]` sections are untouched
- [ ] Failed scrapes are documented (URL + reason)
- [ ] `research-log.md` has new execution record

---

## Example (Abbreviated)

**Input**: competitive-intel.md has 3 competitors with URLs.

> **Competitor A** (homepage scrape):
> - Hero: "The all-in-one marketing platform for growing businesses"
> - CTA: "Start Free Trial" | "See Pricing"
> - Social Proof: "Trusted by 5,000+ businesses" + 6 logos
> - Tone: confident, action-oriented, aspirational
>
> **Competitor A** (pricing scrape):
> - Model: Freemium + 3-tier subscription
> - Free: 500 contacts, basic email
> - Growth: $49/mo | Pro: $149/mo | Enterprise: "Talk to Sales"
>
> **Cross-analysis pattern**:
> - All 3 use "all-in-one" messaging → weak differentiation
> - Nobody targets solo creators specifically → positioning gap
> - $10-40/mo price tier is empty → pricing opportunity

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- **Find competitors** → Use `competitor-finder` (this skill needs URLs as input)
- **Capture visual design/screenshots** → Use `competitor-visual` (Playwright)
- **Analyze reviews or third-party mentions** → Use `competitor-finder` (Perplexity)
- **Make strategic recommendations** → Use `research-synthesizer` (cross-analysis)
- **Create battlecards or positioning docs** → Use marketing execution skills

Competitor Analyzer stays focused on **what competitors actually put on their websites** — their words, their prices, their proof.
