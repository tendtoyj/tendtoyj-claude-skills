# Audience Profiler

> Profile your target audience — segments, buying journey, pain points, and media habits.
> Uses Perplexity for deep customer research. Output feeds voice-of-customer, copy, email, and every execution skill.

---

## Purpose

Audience Profiler answers the question **"Who are we selling to?"** in deep, actionable detail. It produces:
- 2-4 prioritized buyer segments with clear profiles
- A full buying journey map for the primary segment
- Pain points classified by type, severity, and frequency
- A media consumption & attention map showing where your audience actually spends time

The output — `research-memory/customer-insight.md` — becomes the **customer foundation** that voice-of-customer, copywriting, email sequences, SEO, and all execution skills reference.

> "30-60 minutes of boring research = exceptional output for everything that follows." — The Boring Marketer

**Relationship to Market Scanner**: Market Scanner maps *the market*. Audience Profiler maps *the people in that market*.

---

## Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Full Profile** | No `customer-insight.md` exists, or it's an empty scaffold | Run all 5 steps from scratch |
| **Refresh** | `customer-insight.md` already has data | Check `research-log.md` for last scan date → update only changed sections |

---

## Auto-Load Protocol

On every invocation, BEFORE any research:

1. **Check `research-memory/` directory**
2. If files exist → Read ALL `.md` files (except README.md)
3. Use loaded context to:
   - **From `market-landscape.md`**: Pull market structure, customer segments dimension, and trends → use as foundation for segment definition (Step 1)
   - **From `competitive-intel.md`**: Pull competitor target audiences → identify underserved segments and positioning gaps
   - Skip already-covered areas (avoid redundancy)
   - Build on existing findings (deepen, not repeat)
4. **Check `brand-memory/`** (read-only) → If exists, extract target audience info from `voice-profile.md` and `positioning.md` → pre-fill input fields
5. If `customer-insight.md` has data AND `research-log.md` shows a previous profile → **suggest Refresh mode**

---

## Input Gathering

Collect from the user conversationally. Do NOT dump a form — ask naturally.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Product / Service description | YES | What are you selling? |
| Known target audience | YES | Who are you currently selling to (or want to sell to)? |
| Price range / Business model | Optional | B2B high-ticket vs B2C impulse buy → affects journey complexity |
| Existing customer data | Optional | Current customer traits, popular segments, churn patterns |
| Research focus | Optional | Specific area of interest (new segment discovery, deepen existing, etc.) |

**If brand-memory/ exists**, pre-fill from `voice-profile.md` and `positioning.md` — ask user to confirm or correct.

**If market-landscape.md exists**, extract the "By Customer Segment" dimension and propose segment candidates — ask user to confirm, modify, or expand.

**If this is a Refresh**, show the current customer-insight.md summary and ask: "What has changed or what do you want to update?"

---

## Process

### Step 1: Define Audience Segments

**Goal**: Identify 2-4 distinct buyer segments and prioritize them.

**Tool**: `perplexity_reason` (requires analytical reasoning for prioritization)

**Query pattern**:
```
Who are the distinct buyer segments for [product/service] in the [market category] market?

For each segment, define:
- Demographics: age range, role/title, company size (if B2B), geography
- Key characteristics: behavioral patterns, tech savviness, buying habits
- Estimated relative size: approximate % of the addressable market
- Accessibility: how easy to reach through digital marketing channels (easy/medium/hard)
- Willingness to pay: price sensitivity level (high/medium/low)

Prioritize segments by: size x accessibility x willingness to pay.
Identify 2-4 distinct segments — not overlapping personas.
Base this on real market data, not hypothetical archetypes.
```

**Parameters**:
- `search_context_size`: "high"

**If market-landscape.md loaded**: Append to query — "The market structure shows these customer dimensions: [paste By Customer Segment section]. Build on this foundation."

**Output**: 2-4 segments ranked by priority, each with a complete profile.

---

### Step 2: Map Buying Journey (Primary Segment)

**Goal**: Map the complete buying journey for the #1 priority segment across 4 stages.

**Tool**: `perplexity_reason` (requires journey reasoning)

**Query pattern**:
```
Map the complete buying journey for [primary segment description] purchasing [product/service type].

For each stage:

AWARENESS:
- What triggers problem recognition?
- Where do they first look for information?
- Key touchpoints at this stage
- Typical duration

CONSIDERATION:
- What alternatives do they compare?
- What are their evaluation criteria (top 3-5)?
- Key touchpoints and channels used for research
- Main barriers or hesitations

DECISION:
- What triggers the final purchase decision?
- Who else influences or approves the decision?
- What are the final objections or friction points?
- Typical timeline from consideration to purchase

POST-PURCHASE:
- How do they measure success?
- What are the biggest churn/disappointment risks?
- What drives referrals or word-of-mouth?
- When do they become repeat buyers?

Cite real examples or data where possible.
```

**Parameters**:
- `search_context_size`: "high"

**Output**: 4-stage journey map with triggers, touchpoints, barriers, and timelines for each stage.

---

### Step 3: Pain Points & Unmet Needs

**Goal**: Catalog pain points across all segments, classified by type and severity.

**Tool**: `perplexity_ask` (fact-based collection from communities and reviews)

**Query pattern**:
```
What are the biggest pain points and unmet needs for [audience segments from Step 1] when it comes to [product/service category]?

Categorize into three types:

1. FUNCTIONAL PAINS — What current solutions fail to do. Inefficiencies, missing features, poor UX.
2. EMOTIONAL PAINS — Frustrations, anxieties, fears related to the problem or buying process.
3. SOCIAL PAINS — Peer comparison pressure, status concerns, belonging needs, professional image.

For each pain point:
- Rate severity: High / Medium / Low
- Rate frequency: Constant / Intermittent / Event-driven
- Note which segment(s) feel it most
- Cite sources: community discussions, reviews, surveys, industry reports

Also identify UNMET NEEDS — gaps that no current solution adequately addresses.
```

**Parameters**:
- `search_recency_filter`: "year"
- `search_context_size`: "high"

**If competitive-intel.md loaded**: Append — "Known competitors include [list]. Identify pain points that these competitors fail to solve."

**Output**: Categorized pain points with severity/frequency tags + unmet needs (market gaps).

---

### Step 4: Media Consumption & Attention Map

**Goal**: Map where the primary segment spends time and attention online.

**Tool**: `perplexity_ask` (current data on media habits)

**Query pattern**:
```
Where does [primary segment description] spend time online and what media do they consume related to [product/service category]?

Map these 5 dimensions:

1. SOCIAL PLATFORMS: Which ones they use, and how — consume (scroll/read), engage (comment/share), or create (post/publish). Rank by time spent.

2. CONTENT FORMAT PREFERENCES: Rank these by preference — short video, long video, newsletter, blog post, podcast, social post, webinar, course/tutorial.

3. COMMUNITIES: Specific online communities — Reddit subreddits, Slack/Discord groups, Facebook groups, forums, membership communities. Name specific ones.

4. INFLUENCERS & MEDIA: Key thought leaders, publications, newsletters, YouTube channels they follow in this space. Name specific ones.

5. SEARCH BEHAVIOR: How they find information — Google, YouTube, ChatGPT/AI, Reddit, TikTok, asking peers, etc. What's their default "search engine" for this topic?

Cite any available research, surveys, or data on this audience's media habits.
```

**Parameters**:
- `search_recency_filter`: "month"
- `search_context_size`: "high"

**Output**: 5-dimension attention map with specific platform/community/influencer names.

## Perplexity MCP Tool Guide

| Tool | When to Use | This Skill |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `perplexity_reason` | Analytical reasoning, prioritization | Step 1 (segment definition + ranking), Step 2 (journey mapping) |
| `perplexity_ask` | Factual Q&A, current data | Step 3 (pain points), Step 4 (media consumption) |
| `perplexity_search` | Find specific URLs/reports | Only if Steps 1-4 need survey/report source verification |

**Common parameters**:
- `search_context_size`: Always `"high"` — customer research needs comprehensive context
- `search_recency_filter`: `"month"` for media habits (Step 4), `"year"` for pain points (Step 3)

**Query best practices**:
- Be specific: Include the exact segment description in every query
- Ask for sources: Always request citations from communities, surveys, reports
- One topic per query: Don't combine segments + journey + pain points in one call
- Name names: Ask for specific communities, influencers, platforms — not generic categories

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- **Customer language mining** → Use `voice-of-customer` (collects actual words/phrases customers use)
- **Market sizing** → Use `market-scanner` (maps market, not people)
- **Competitor analysis** → Use `competitor-finder` / `competitor-analyzer`
- **Strategic recommendations** → Use `research-synthesizer` (reads this output)

Audience Profiler stays focused on **understanding the people** — who they are, how they buy, what hurts, and where they pay attention.
