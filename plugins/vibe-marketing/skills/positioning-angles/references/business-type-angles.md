## Info / Education / Creators

### Unique Challenges
- Selling transformation, not a tangible product
- Building authority before asking for the sale
- Positioning against free content and competitors
- The "guru" skepticism problem — audiences are burned out on empty promises
- High-ticket offers require high trust

### Proven Angle Patterns

**The Anti-Guru** (Framework: Anti-Positioning)
- "Not another marketing bro promising you'll 10x"
- Reject the hype. Position as the honest, no-BS alternative.
- Works because: audience is exhausted by inflated claims

**The Methodology Transfer** (Framework: Unique Mechanism)
- "What took me 5 years, packaged for you"
- Sell compressed time. The shortcut is the value.
- Works because: people pay to skip the learning curve

**The Community Angle** (Framework: Specificity + Emotional Framing)
- "Not just a course — a room of practitioners"
- The product is the people, not just the content.
- Works because: belonging and peer access are high-value

**The Results-First** (Framework: Transformation)
- "Here's what [specific person] built in [specific timeframe]"
- Lead with proof, not promises.
- Works because: concrete results cut through skepticism

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Positioning on credentials alone ("I have 15 years of experience")
- Vague transformation promises ("unlock your potential")
- Copying competitor pricing/packaging without differentiation

## Consulting / Agency

### Unique Challenges
- Selling time and expertise (limited inventory)
- Differentiation in crowded markets
- The "why you vs. anyone else" problem
- Balancing client acquisition with delivery capacity

### Proven Angle Patterns

**The Specialist** (Framework: Specificity)
- "We only work with [specific niche]"
- Narrow focus signals deep expertise.
- Works because: clients trust specialists more than generalists for important problems

**The Methodology** (Framework: Unique Mechanism)
- "Our proprietary [Process Name] ensures [outcome]"
- Name your process. Make it tangible.
- Works because: a named method feels more reliable than "we'll figure it out"

**The Results** (Framework: Transformation)
- "We've generated [specific outcome] for [number] clients"
- Specificity sells. Numbers > adjectives.
- Works because: quantified results reduce perceived risk

**The Anti-Agency** (Framework: Anti-Positioning)
- "No fluff. No BS. Just the work that matters."
- Position against everything clients hate about agencies: slow timelines, vague deliverables, junior staff doing senior-priced work.
- Works because: most agency buyers have been burned before

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Trying to serve every industry (dilutes expertise signal)
- Leading with process instead of outcomes
- Competing on price (race to the bottom)

### Compound Strategy
Best clients come from best clients. Content builds reputation. Reputation generates referrals. Referrals become case studies. Case studies become content. Compound.

## E-commerce

### Unique Challenges
- Competing on more than price
- Product differentiation when features are similar
- Building brand in commodity markets
- Email as a revenue driver, not just nurture

### Proven Angle Patterns

**The Quality Story** (Framework: Unique Mechanism)
- "Why we chose [specific material/process]"
- Transparency about craft signals premium quality.
- Works because: consumers associate transparency with trustworthiness

**The Founder Story** (Framework: Emotional Framing)
- "I built this because [personal reason]"
- Origin stories create emotional connection.
- Works because: people buy from people, especially when the story resonates with their values

**The Anti-Mass-Market** (Framework: Anti-Positioning + Specificity)
- "Not for everyone. Built for [specific person]."
- Exclusion creates desire. Specificity signals quality.
- Works because: "not for everyone" implies premium without saying it

**The Lifestyle** (Framework: Emotional Framing + Specificity)
- "For people who [identity marker]"
- Sell belonging to an identity, not just a product.
- Works because: identity-based positioning creates brand loyalty beyond the product

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Leading with features instead of outcomes or identity
- Discounting as a positioning strategy (erodes brand)
- Ignoring user-generated content (customer photos, reviews, unboxings are your best marketing)

### Compound Strategy
Every customer photo is an ad. Every review is copy. Every unboxing video is content. You're not creating marketing — you're curating what customers already give you.

## SaaS

### Unique Challenges
- Feature parity (everyone has similar features)
- Free / freemium competitors
- Trial → paid conversion
- Churn and retention

### Proven Angle Patterns

**The Simplicity Angle** (Framework: Anti-Positioning + Speed/Convenience)
- "The [category] that just works"
- Position against bloated, complex alternatives.
- Works because: tool fatigue is real — simplicity is a feature

**The Speed Angle** (Framework: Speed/Convenience)
- "Get started in 5 minutes, not 5 weeks"
- Time-to-value is the killer differentiator.
- Works because: enterprise tools trained buyers to expect painful onboarding

**The Integration Angle** (Framework: Specificity + Unique Mechanism)
- "Built for teams already using [popular tool]"
- Piggyback on an existing ecosystem.
- Works because: every integration is a distribution channel — their users become your users

**The Anti-Enterprise** (Framework: Anti-Positioning)
- "No implementation fees. No sales calls. Just sign up."
- Position against everything SMBs hate about enterprise software.
- Works because: SMBs associate "enterprise" with expensive, slow, and locked-in

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Feature-list positioning ("we have 50+ features")
- Competing with free on free's terms (compete on value, not price)
- Positioning on technology instead of user outcomes

### Compound Strategy
Every integration is a distribution channel. You're not just connecting tools — you're connecting audiences. Their users become your users.
