Detailed structure, section-by-section guidance, and example outlines for all 9 newsletter formats. Referenced by the main Newsletter skill when writing in Mode 2.

---

## Format 1: Curated

**What it is**: Best links, tools, and resources on a topic — delivered with your editorial commentary.

**Why it works**: You become the trusted filter. Subscribers save time because you've done the reading for them. Low production effort, high positioning value.

### Section-by-Section Structure

1. **Intro** (2-3 sentences)
   - This week's theme in one line
   - Why it matters right now
   - Optional: tie to something personal or timely

2. **Curated Items** (5-7 items)
   - For each item:
     - **Title + Source** (linked)
     - **Your take** (1-2 sentences — this is the value; not just a link dump)
     - **Why it matters** (half-sentence connecting to the reader)

3. **Editor's Pick** (1 item, expanded)
   - Go deeper on the most valuable item
   - 3-5 sentences of analysis or application
   - How the reader can use this

4. **CTA**
   - "Forward this to someone who'd find it useful"
   - "Reply with something I should include next week"

### Subject Line Patterns
- "This week in [topic]: [most interesting item]"
- "[Number] things worth your time this week"
- "The [topic] links I saved for you"
- "[Topic] roundup: [hook from best item]"

### Example Outline: Marketing Curation Newsletter

```
Subject: "5 marketing finds worth your Tuesday"
Preview: "Including one tool I wish I'd found sooner"

Intro: This week, everyone's talking about [trend]. I dug
through the noise to find what actually matters.

1. [Article] The $0 SEO trick that small businesses miss
   → My take: "This is what I tell every new client first."

2. [Tool] New free email subject line tester
   → My take: "Tested it on my last 5 sends. Option B always won."

3. [Thread] A SaaS founder shared their full content calendar
   → My take: "Steal the Tuesday/Thursday rhythm. It works."

4. [Report] State of email marketing 2026
   → My take: "Page 12 has the stat that changes everything."

5. [Video] 8-minute masterclass on landing page copy
   → My take: "Skip to 3:42 for the headline formula."

Editor's Pick: [Deep dive on item #4 — the specific stat,
what it means, how to apply it this week]

CTA: "Hit reply — what did I miss this week?"
```

## Format 2: Story-Driven

**What it is**: A personal narrative — experience, observation, or moment — that connects to a business lesson.

**Why it works**: Stories bypass the rational filter. Readers remember stories 22x more than facts. Builds the deepest reader loyalty of any format.

### Section-by-Section Structure

1. **Hook** (1-3 sentences)
   - Drop the reader into a specific moment
   - Concrete detail: time, place, sensory information
   - Create a question in the reader's mind

2. **Narrative** (3-5 short paragraphs)
   - Unfold the story with tension
   - Include dialogue where possible
   - Build toward a turning point

3. **Turning Point** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - The moment of realization or change
   - What shifted in your understanding

4. **Lesson Extraction** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Connect the story to a principle the reader can use
   - Make the bridge explicit: "Here's what this means for you..."
   - Be specific — not generic advice

5. **Reader Application** (1 paragraph)
   - One concrete thing the reader can do or think about
   - Frame as a question: "Ask yourself: [question]"

6. **CTA**
   - "Have a similar experience? Hit reply — I read every one"
   - "Forward this to someone who needs to hear this"

### Subject Line Patterns
- "What [specific moment] taught me about [topic]"
- "Why I stopped [common practice]"
- "The [day/moment] everything changed"
- "I was wrong about [assumption]"

### Example Outline: Founder Story Newsletter

```
Subject: "The client I should have fired in week one"
Preview: "I ignored every red flag. Here's what it cost me."

Hook: "Three months in, I was working 14-hour days for
a client who paid $2,000/month. My best client was
getting my worst work. Something had to break."

Narrative: [How the engagement started — the warning signs
— the escalation — the breaking point]

Turning point: "The moment I realized I wasn't running a
business. I was running a prison I'd built myself."

Lesson: Revenue isn't the metric. Revenue per hour of
your sanity is the metric. [Expand with specifics]

Application: "Look at your client list right now. Who
gives you energy? Who drains it? The answer tells you
everything about your next 12 months."

CTA: "Reply with your version of this story. I bet
we have more in common than you think."
```

---

## Format 3: How-To / Tutorial

**What it is**: Step-by-step instructions the reader can execute immediately.

**Why it works**: Delivers tangible value in every issue. Readers bookmark and save these. Positions you as the practical expert, not just a talker.

### Section-by-Section Structure

1. **Problem / Goal Statement** (2-3 sentences)
   - Name the specific problem or desired outcome
   - Quantify if possible: "Most [audience] spend [X hours] on this"
   - Make the reader feel seen

2. **Why This Matters** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Connect to a bigger goal or pain point
   - What happens if they don't fix this

3. **Steps** (3-7 steps)
   - For each step:
     - **Step title** (action-oriented: "Set up...", "Write...", "Test...")
     - **What to do** (2-4 sentences, specific and concrete)
     - **Pro tip or common mistake** (optional, 1 sentence)
   - Include screenshots, templates, or examples where possible

4. **Expected Result** (1 paragraph)
   - What success looks like after completing all steps
   - Realistic timeframe

5. **Quick Win** (1 paragraph)
   - "If you only do one thing from this email, do step [X]"
   - Lowest effort, highest impact action

6. **CTA**
   - "Try step 1 today and reply with what happened"
   - "Download the template: [link]"

### Subject Line Patterns
- "How to [result] in [timeframe]"
- "[Number]-step guide to [specific outcome]"
- "The exact process I use to [achieve result]"
- "Do this in [X] minutes to fix your [problem]"

### Example Outline: Marketing Tutorial Newsletter

```
Subject: "Fix your Google profile in 10 minutes"
Preview: "Step 3 is the one everyone skips (and it matters most)"

Problem: "Your Google Business Profile is the first thing
potential customers see. If it's incomplete, you're losing
jobs to the shop down the street."

Why it matters: [80% of local searches → GBP. Incomplete
profiles get 70% fewer clicks. Data.]

Step 1: Update your service area (2 min)
Step 2: Add 5 real photos from this month (3 min)
Step 3: Write a 150-word description with your top 3 services (3 min)
Step 4: Respond to your last 3 reviews (2 min)

Expected result: "Within 2 weeks, you should see a 15-30%
increase in profile views."

Quick win: "Do step 3 right now. Most competitors have
the default 'We are a [business type]' description.
Yours will immediately stand out."

CTA: "Done? Reply with your business name — I'll take
a quick look and tell you what else jumps out."
```

## Format 4: Case Study

**What it is**: A real example broken down — what happened, why it worked, and what the reader can steal.

**Why it works**: Proof sells. Case studies demonstrate expertise without bragging. Each one is an indirect sales pitch disguised as education.

### Section-by-Section Structure

1. **Result First** (1-2 sentences)
   - Lead with the outcome as a number
   - "From X to Y in Z months"

2. **Background** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Who is this about? (anonymize if needed)
   - What was their situation before?
   - What had they already tried?

3. **What We Did** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - The specific actions taken
   - Be concrete: tools, tactics, timeline
   - Don't hide the methodology — generosity builds trust

4. **Key Insight** (1 paragraph)
   - The non-obvious thing that made the difference
   - "The breakthrough wasn't [obvious thing]. It was [unexpected thing]."

5. **Why It Worked** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Connect the tactic to a principle
   - Make it transferable to other contexts

6. **Reader Takeaway** (1 paragraph)
   - "Here's what you can steal from this..."
   - 1-2 specific actions the reader can apply to their own situation

7. **CTA**
   - "Want similar results? [Book a call / try this yourself]"
   - "Know someone who needs this? Forward this issue"

### Subject Line Patterns
- "How [company/person] achieved [specific result]"
- "[Result number]: What [X] did differently"
- "From [before state] to [after state] in [timeframe]"
- "The [industry] case study everyone should read"

### Example Outline: Client Case Study Newsletter

```
Subject: "47% more booked jobs in 60 days"
Preview: "What a Phoenix plumbing company changed (it wasn't their ads)"

Result: "Mike's Plumbing went from 12 booked jobs/week to
18 — without increasing ad spend by a single dollar."

Background: [Family plumbing business, 15 years in Phoenix,
tried 4 agencies, spending $3K/month on Google Ads with
diminishing returns]

What we did:
1. Fixed response time (from 4 hours to 12 minutes)
2. Rebuilt Google Business Profile with real job photos
3. Added a "Get a quote in 60 seconds" form to every page

Key insight: "The ads were fine. The follow-up was broken.
70% of leads weren't getting a call back within 2 hours."

Why it worked: [Speed signals professionalism in trades.
The customer doesn't care about your brand — they care
about who picks up the phone.]

Reader takeaway: "Check your average response time this
week. If it's over 30 minutes, that's your biggest leak."

CTA: "Want us to run this analysis on your business?
Book a free 15-minute audit."
```

## Format 5: Behind-the-Scenes

**What it is**: Pull back the curtain on your process, decisions, numbers, or mistakes.

**Why it works**: Transparency is rare and magnetic. Sharing real numbers builds trust faster than any testimonial. Creates superfans.

### Section-by-Section Structure

1. **What You're Revealing** (1-2 sentences)
   - Set expectations: "This month, I'm sharing [what]"
   - Frame the vulnerability: "Not many people talk about this"

2. **The Real Story / Numbers** (3-5 paragraphs)
   - Specific details: dates, numbers, screenshots
   - Be unflinchingly honest — include the bad parts
   - Use tables or bullet points for data

3. **What Worked** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Highlight genuine wins
   - Attribute success honestly (skill vs. luck vs. timing)

4. **What Didn't** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Failures or surprises
   - What you expected vs. what happened
   - No spin — readers smell BS instantly

5. **Lessons Learned** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - What you'll do differently next time
   - Connect to principles the reader can apply

6. **CTA**
   - "What should I share next month? Reply and tell me"
   - "Reply with your biggest question about [topic]"

### Subject Line Patterns
- "Inside look: our [month/quarter] numbers"
- "Our [month] report (the real one)"
- "I made a $[X] mistake. Here's what I learned."
- "What nobody sees behind [your product/service]"

### Example Outline: Business Transparency Newsletter

```
Subject: "Our January numbers (the real ones)"
Preview: "Revenue, costs, what worked, what flopped"

Revealing: "Every month, I share Boring Money's real
numbers. No cherry-picking. Here's January."

Numbers:
- Revenue: $42,000 (up 12% from Dec)
- New clients: 3
- Clients lost: 1 (and why)
- Marketing spend: $1,200
- Biggest expense surprise: [what]

What worked: [The newsletter → 2 of 3 new clients
came from replies to December's case study issue]

What didn't: [Tried TikTok ads — $400, 0 leads.
Not our audience. Should have known.]

Lessons: "Our newsletter is our best sales tool.
Not the ads. Not the cold outreach. The thing I
almost didn't start because 'who reads newsletters?'"

CTA: "What do you want me to share next month?
Reply with a topic — pricing? processes? tools?"
```

---

## Format 6: Industry Analysis

**What it is**: Your take on what's happening in the industry — news, trends, changes — with actionable interpretation.

**Why it works**: Positions you as a thinking leader, not just a practitioner. Readers come to you to understand what matters and what to ignore. Highest open rates when timely.

### Section-by-Section Structure

1. **The News / Trend** (1-2 sentences)
   - State what happened or what's changing
   - Be sharp and specific — not vague

2. **Context** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Why is this happening now?
   - What led to this moment?

3. **Your Analysis** (2-3 paragraphs)

   - Connect to patterns you're seeing firsthand

4. **Impact on the Reader** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - "What this means for [your audience]..."
   - Be specific to their context — not generic industry commentary

   - Time-bound: "This week, do [X]"

6. **CTA**
   - "What's your take? Reply — I want to hear how this hits for you"
   - "Share this with your team" (for B2B)

### Subject Line Patterns
- "What [event/trend] means for [your audience]"
- "[Industry] is changing. Here's what matters."
- "[News item] — my honest take"
- "Everyone's wrong about [topic]. Here's why."

### Example Outline: Industry Trend Newsletter

```
Subject: "Google just changed local search (again)"
Preview: "What it means for your marketing this quarter"

News: "Google rolled out [specific update] last week.
Most agencies haven't noticed yet. You should."

Context: [Why Google made this change. The trend toward
[pattern]. What this continues/reverses.]

Analysis: "Most people will tell you to [common reaction].
I think that's wrong. Here's what I'm seeing with our
clients: [specific observations from real data]."

Impact: "If you're a local business spending money on
Google Ads, this changes your [specific thing].
If you're relying on organic, [different implication]."

Action items:
- This week: Audit your [specific thing]
- This month: Shift budget from [X] to [Y]
- Watch for: [Next signal to look for]

CTA: "What changes are you seeing? Reply — I'm
collecting data points from real businesses."
```

## Format 7: Q&A / Mailbag

**What it is**: Answer reader questions publicly. Curate the best questions, give thoughtful answers, and invite more.

**Why it works**: Turns your newsletter into a two-way conversation. Reduces content creation burden (readers generate the topics). Builds community — readers feel heard.

### Section-by-Section Structure

1. **Intro** (2-3 sentences)
   - Thank readers for submitting questions
   - Tease the best question of this batch
   - Set expectations (how many you'll answer)

2. **Questions + Answers** (3-5 Q&As)
   - For each:
     - **Question** (quoted, attributed to first name or anonymous)
     - **Answer** (3-5 paragraphs — give real value, not surface answers)
     - **One-line takeaway** (bolded)

3. **Next Month's Prompt** (1-2 sentences)
   - Specific question to seed the next mailbag
   - "Next month: I'm tackling [theme]. Send your questions."

4. **CTA**
   - "Submit your question: [reply / form link]"
   - "The best questions get answered in next month's issue"

### Subject Line Patterns
- "You asked, I answered: [best question topic]"
- "Your top [number] questions about [topic]"
- "[Reader name] asked something I've never been asked before"
- "The question everyone's afraid to ask about [topic]"

### Example Outline: Reader Q&A Newsletter

```
Subject: "You asked about pricing. Here's the truth."
Preview: "Plus: the question I get most (and hate answering)"

Intro: "Last month I asked: 'What's the one marketing
question keeping you up at night?' 47 of you replied.
Here are the 3 that resonated most."

Q1: "How do I know if my marketing agency is ripping me off?"
— Sarah, HVAC company owner, Texas
A: [Honest, detailed answer with specific red flags and
benchmarks. Not self-serving — actually helpful.]
Takeaway: **If they can't show you the math, they don't have math to show.**

Q2: "Should I be on TikTok?"
— Anonymous
A: [Nuanced answer: depends on your customer demographic.
Data on where trade business customers actually are.]
Takeaway: **Go where your customers scroll, not where marketers tell you to be.**

Q3: "What's the minimum I should spend on marketing?"
— Dave, roofing contractor, Ohio
A: [Specific framework: % of revenue, minimum viable budget,
where to start if money is tight]
Takeaway: **$500/month spent right beats $5,000/month spent blind.**

Next month: "I'm diving into 'hiring your first marketing
person vs. staying with an agency.' Send your questions."

CTA: "Hit reply with your question. I read every one."
```

---

## Format 8: Data / Research

**What it is**: Original insights derived from data — your own metrics, surveys, industry analysis, or experiments.

**Why it works**: Data newsletters get shared more than any other format. They're quotable, screenshot-able, and position you as a primary source. Other newsletters cite you.

### Section-by-Section Structure

1. **Headline Finding** (1-2 sentences)
   - Lead with the most surprising or useful data point
   - "We analyzed [X]. The #1 finding: [finding]."

2. **Methodology** (1 paragraph)
   - Where the data came from (your clients, survey, tool, public data)
   - Sample size and timeframe
   - Brief enough to establish credibility, not a full research paper

3. **Key Findings** (3-5 insights)
   - For each:
     - **The data point** (specific number)
     - **What it means** (1-2 sentence interpretation)
     - **Visual or formatting** (bold the number, use comparison)

4. **The Big Takeaway** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Synthesize the findings into one overarching insight
   - "The story the data tells is..."

5. **Actionable Recommendations** (2-3 bullet points)
   - Based on the data, what should the reader do?
   - Be specific and time-bound

6. **CTA**
   - "Download the full dataset / report"
   - "Reply with what surprised you most"
   - "Share this with your team"

### Subject Line Patterns
- "We analyzed [number] [things]. Here's what we found."
- "The data says [surprising finding]"
- "[Counterintuitive stat] — and what to do about it"
- "New data: [topic] in [year]"

### Example Outline: Data Insight Newsletter

```
Subject: "We analyzed 200 trade businesses' marketing"
Preview: "Finding #3 will change how you think about ads"

Headline finding: "The #1 predictor of marketing ROI for
trade businesses isn't ad spend. It's response time."

Methodology: "We analyzed 200 Boring Money clients across
12 trades over 6 months. Here's what the data shows."

Finding 1: Businesses that respond in <15 minutes close
3.2x more leads than those responding in 1+ hours.

Finding 2: Google Business Profile completeness correlates
with 40% higher click-through on local search.

Finding 3: The average trade business wastes 35% of their
ad budget on keywords that never convert. [Breakdown]

Finding 4: Email marketing ROI for trades is $42 per $1
spent — but only 12% of trade businesses use it.

Big takeaway: "The boring fundamentals (speed, profiles,
email) crush the flashy tactics (TikTok, influencers)
by a wide margin. The data is clear."

Recommendations:
- This week: Measure your average response time
- This month: Complete your Google Business Profile to 100%
- This quarter: Start a simple email sequence

CTA: "Want the full report with all 200 data points?
Download it here: [link]"
```

## Format 9: Hybrid

**What it is**: A combination of 2-3 formats in fixed recurring sections. The most flexible and sustainable format.

**Why it works**: Variety prevents reader fatigue. Fixed sections build expectations. You can rotate the "main course" while keeping the "side dishes" consistent. Most successful newsletters use this format.

### Section-by-Section Structure

1. **Personal Note** (2-3 sentences)
   - Story-Driven element: a quick personal observation or moment
   - Connects to the theme of the issue
   - Sets the human tone

2. **Main Content** (1 format, rotated each issue)
   - Rotate between: Story / How-To / Case Study / Industry Analysis
   - This is the "main course" — the most substantial section
   - Follow the structure template for the chosen format (above)

3. **Curated Section** (3-5 items)
   - Curated element: the best links/resources this week
   - Short format: title + your one-sentence take + link
   - Lower effort — gives variety without the production burden

4. **Quick Win** (1 paragraph)
   - Tutorial element: one specific, actionable thing to do right now
   - Must be completable in under 10 minutes
   - The thing readers forward to colleagues

5. **CTA** (1 clear action)
   - Rotates based on business need:
     - "Reply" weeks: community building
     - "Forward" weeks: growth
     - "Click" weeks: conversion

### Subject Line Patterns
- Follow the main content format's patterns
- Example: If main is Case Study, use Case Study subject line formula
- Avoid generic subjects like "This week's newsletter" — always lead with the hook

### Hybrid Rotation Schedule Example

```
Issue 1: Story (main) + Curated + Quick Win
Issue 2: How-To (main) + Curated + Quick Win
Issue 3: Case Study (main) + Curated + Quick Win
Issue 4: Industry Analysis (main) + Curated + Quick Win
[Repeat with new topics]
```

### Example Outline: Hybrid Newsletter

```
Subject: "The client who taught me to say no"
Preview: "Plus 3 links and a 5-minute marketing fix"

Personal note: "I've been thinking a lot about boundaries
this week. Not the 'set boundaries' Instagram kind.
The 'fire a paying client' kind."

Main (Story-Driven): [The story of turning down a client
who didn't fit, what it cost short-term, what it gained
long-term. Lesson: alignment beats revenue.]

3 Boring Things Worth Reading:
1. [Link] — How to price consulting without underselling
2. [Link] — The email template that gets 60% response rates
3. [Link] — Why most marketing audits are useless (and one that isn't)

Quick Win: "Open your inbox. Find the last 5 inquiry emails
you received. How fast did you reply? If the average is
over 1 hour, that's your #1 fix this week."

CTA: "Reply with the hardest business decision you've
made this year. I'm collecting stories for a future issue."
```
