## Hook Extraction — Extended Examples

### From a Blog Post (SEO Content)

Source: "5 Email Marketing Mistakes Costing You Revenue"

```
HOOK #1 — Data ★
"The average company loses $42 per subscriber per year from bad email hygiene."
→ Best for: LinkedIn (opening stat), Twitter/X (single tweet)

HOOK #2 — Contrarian
"Stop A/B testing subject lines. It's the least important part of your email."
→ Best for: Twitter/X (quote angle), LinkedIn (debate starter)

HOOK #3 — Actionable
"Check your unsubscribe page right now. If it says 'Sorry to see you go' you're losing money."

## Traffic Flywheel Context

Content Atomizer is one stage in a continuous cycle. Understanding the full flywheel helps write better CTAs and choose the right hooks.

```
CREATE → One core piece (blog, podcast, video)
    ↓
ATOMIZE → Content Atomizer → 15+ platform-specific pieces
    ↓
VISUALIZE → Social Graphics, Product Photos/Videos
    ↓
DISTRIBUTE → Post to platforms (organic + paid + email)
    ↓
CAPTURE → Lead magnets in posts drive opt-ins
    ↓
CONVERT → Email sequences + direct response copy close the sale
    ↓
LEARN → What worked? Record in learnings.md
    ↓
REPEAT → Next content piece, informed by what worked
```

**How this affects Content Atomizer outputs:**

- **CAPTURE stage**: Every atomized piece should include at least one path to a lead magnet. Not aggressive — a natural "want more? grab this free [thing]" bridge
- **LEARN stage**: The posting checklist includes a performance tracking section. After 7 days, the user records what worked — this feeds the next REPEAT cycle
- **REPEAT stage**: In Mode 4 (Repurpose), past performance data informs which hooks to amplify. The flywheel gets smarter each rotation
