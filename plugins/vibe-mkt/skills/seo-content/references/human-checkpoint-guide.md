# Human Checkpoint Guide

> "Before publishing ANY AI-generated content: Fact-check all claims, verify links, add your unique perspective, remove AI tells." — Vibe Marketing Playbook

This guide is the expanded version of the Human Checkpoint referenced in the SEO Content skill. Every piece of content must pass this before publishing.

---

## 1. Fact-Check & Accuracy

### Statistics & Numbers
- [ ] Every statistic has a named source (not just "studies show")
- [ ] Source is recent (within 2 years for fast-moving topics, within 5 for evergreen)
- [ ] Numbers haven't been hallucinated — verify against the actual source
- [ ] Percentages and calculations are mathematically correct

### Claims & Assertions
- [ ] Factual claims are verifiable (can you find the original source?)
- [ ] Opinions are clearly framed as opinions ("we believe", "in our experience")
- [ ] Comparative claims are fair and accurate ("faster than X" — is it really?)
- [ ] Predictions are reasonable and qualified

### Links & References
- [ ] All links resolve (no 404s, no unexpected redirects)
- [ ] Linked pages actually support the claim they're cited for
- [ ] External links go to authoritative, trustworthy sources
- [ ] Internal links are relevant (not just random pages for SEO juice)

### Currency
- [ ] Product names and features are current
- [ ] Pricing information is current (or marked as "at time of writing")
- [ ] Tools and platforms mentioned still exist and function as described
- [ ] Legal or regulatory information is current for the relevant jurisdiction

## 2. Expertise & Originality (E-E-A-T)

Google's E-E-A-T framework (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) matters. AI can write competent content — only YOU can add genuine expertise.

### Experience
- [ ] Does the content include first-hand experience or observation?
- [ ] Are there specific examples from real projects, clients, or experiments?
- [ ] Can the reader tell this was written by someone who has DONE the thing, not just researched it?

### Expertise
- [ ] Is there at least one insight that can't be found by Googling the topic?
- [ ] Does the content go beyond surface-level advice?
- [ ] Would an expert in the field nod along — or roll their eyes?

### Authoritativeness
- [ ] Does the content cite its own prior work or track record where relevant?
- [ ] Are claims backed by evidence (data, case studies, results)?
- [ ] Is the author/brand clearly positioned as qualified to write about this?

### Trustworthiness
- [ ] Are limitations and caveats acknowledged? (e.g., "This works for X but not Y")
- [ ] Is the content honest about what it doesn't know?
- [ ] Are affiliate links or commercial interests disclosed?

### What to Add
After reviewing the AI draft, insert at least 2-3 of these:
- A real example from your own experience
- A contrarian take or nuanced opinion
- Specific results or metrics from your work
- A lesson learned from failure
- An insight that only comes from doing, not reading

## 3. AI Tell Removal — Complete Guide

AI-generated content has recognizable patterns. Remove them all.

### Forbidden Words & Phrases

**Single words to eliminate:**

| Word | Why it's a tell | Replace with |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| delve | Nobody talks like this | explore, dig into, look at |
| landscape | (metaphorical) AI default for "environment" | space, market, industry |
| paradigm | Academic-sounding filler | approach, model, framework |
| tapestry | AI-poetic nonsense | mix, combination, range |
| unleash | Overly dramatic | use, apply, activate |
| leverage | (as verb) Corporate buzzword | use, apply, build on |
| navigate | (metaphorical) AI default for "deal with" | handle, work through, manage |
| realm | Fantasy novel energy | area, field, space |
| myriad | Unnecessarily fancy | many, numerous, dozens of |
| plethora | See above | plenty of, many, a range of |
| robust | AI-favorite adjective | strong, solid, comprehensive |
| seamless | Almost always hyperbolic | smooth, easy, simple |
| pivotal | Overly dramatic | important, key, critical |
| foster | AI-bureaucratic | build, create, encourage |

**Phrase patterns to eliminate:**

| Pattern | Replace with |
|---------|-------------|
| "In today's [fast-paced/ever-changing/digital] world" | Cut entirely or state the specific context |
| "It's important to note that" | Just state the thing |
| "As we navigate the complexities of" | Cut entirely |
| "In the realm of" | "In [topic]" |
| "It's worth noting that" | Just note it |
| "At the end of the day" | Cut or use "ultimately" |
| "When it comes to [X]" | "For [X]" or just start with X |
| "In conclusion" | Don't announce it — just conclude |
| "Without further ado" | Cut entirely |
| "Let's dive in" | Cut or use "Here's how" |
| "This comprehensive guide will" | Cut entirely — just guide them |

**Adverb overuse to trim:**

| Trim these | Because |
|-----------|---------|
| truly, really, very | Usually add nothing |
| incredibly, amazingly | Hyperbolic filler |
| absolutely, completely | Overemphasis |
| fundamentally, essentially | Padding |
| significantly, substantially | Vague — use specific numbers instead |

### The Read-Aloud Test

After removing individual tells, read the full piece aloud. Listen for:
- **Rhythm**: Does it sound natural or robotic? Human writing has varied sentence length
- **Personality**: Does it sound like the brand, or like a corporate press release?
- **Specificity**: Are claims concrete or full of vague qualifiers?
- **Energy**: Is the enthusiasm genuine or performative?

If any section sounds like "a language model trying to sound smart," rewrite it in plain language.

## 4. Brand Voice Final Check

### Vocabulary Audit
- Read through the piece and highlight any word from the AVOID list in voice-profile.md
- Count how many USE words are present — aim for at least 3-5 per 500 words
- Check that industry jargon matches the audience's level (too simple = condescending, too complex = alienating)

### Tone Consistency
- Does the opening match the closing? (No personality drift)
- Are all sections written in the same voice? (Watch for sections that "reset" to generic tone)
- Does humor, if present, match the brand's style?

### Personality Checkpoint
- Read the Core Personality Traits from voice-profile.md
- For each trait, find at least one sentence that exemplifies it
- If a trait is missing entirely, add content that expresses it

- [ ] Meta description would make you click if you saw it in search results
- [ ] URL slug is clean and readable

## 6. Business Type Considerations

### Info/Education Businesses
- Content should teach genuinely — not just tease a paid product
- Depth matters more than breadth
- Cite sources generously — your audience values rigor
- Lead magnet: offer deeper dives (courses, detailed guides)

### Consulting/Agency Businesses
- Show don't tell — use real examples and results
- Local content needs genuine local knowledge
- Position as the expert who has done this, not just studied it
- Lead magnet: audits, assessments, strategy sessions

### E-commerce Businesses
- Comparison content must be fair (even when comparing to competitors)
- Include pricing information when possible (users expect it)
- Product-focused content needs genuine reviews or testing
- Lead magnet: discounts, exclusive access, buying guides

### SaaS Businesses
- Technical accuracy is paramount — developers will call out errors
- Comparison pages need current feature data
- Integration/how-to content should include code snippets or screenshots
- Lead magnet: free trials, sandboxes, templates
