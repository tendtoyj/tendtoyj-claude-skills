# 6 Circles Method — Detailed Evaluation Guide

This reference expands each circle with specific evaluation criteria, sub-questions, and scoring guidance. Use when you need deeper analysis beyond the summary in the main skill file.

---

## Circle 1: Business Expertise

**Core question**: "Can we write about this topic with genuine authority?"

### Scoring criteria

**High (3)** — This is your core domain. You have:
- Direct experience delivering this service or solving this problem
- Proprietary data, case studies, or original insights to share
- Credentials or track record that establish E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)

**Medium (2)** — Adjacent to your expertise. You have:
- Related knowledge that transfers meaningfully
- Access to experts or partners who can contribute
- Ability to write competently, but not with "insider" depth

**Low (1)** — Outside your domain. You would:
- Need to research heavily with no unique angle
- Sound like anyone else writing about this topic
- Risk producing generic, undifferentiated content

### Sub-questions
- Would a reader recognize us as a credible source on this topic?
- Can we add something to this conversation that doesn't already exist?
- Do we have stories, data, or examples from our own work to include?

---

## Circle 2: Audience Pain Points

**Core question**: "Does our target audience actively search this when they're struggling?"

### Scoring criteria

**High (3)** — Direct pain. The audience:
- Searches this exact topic when they have an urgent problem
- Uses these words to describe their situation (validated by `audience.md`)
- Would prioritize solving this over other tasks today

**Medium (2)** — Indirect pain. The audience:
- Searches this topic while researching a related problem
- Would find it useful but isn't actively looking for it
- Needs education to realize this is relevant to them

**Low (1)** — Distant relevance. The audience:
- Rarely or never searches this
- Wouldn't recognize the connection to their problems
- Would scroll past this in search results

### Sub-questions
- If you put this keyword in front of your ideal customer, would they say "yes, that's exactly my problem"?
- Would they describe this problem using these exact words, or do they use different language?
- Is this a "right now" problem or a "someday" problem?

## Circle 3: Search Volume

**Core question**: "Is there enough search traffic to justify creating content?"

### Scoring criteria

**High (3)** — 1,000+ monthly searches. Mass-market keyword.

**Medium (2)** — 100-999 monthly searches. Solid niche keyword. Often the sweet spot — enough traffic to matter, but not so competitive that you can't rank.

**Low (1)** — 10-99 monthly searches. Micro-niche. Still valuable if:
- Purchase intent is high (each visitor is worth a lot)
- Part of a programmatic set (100 pages × 30 searches = 3,000 combined)
- Highly specific to your exact audience

### Important context
- Volume thresholds shift by industry. For a B2B SaaS company, 200 monthly searches on a "pricing" keyword might be more valuable than 5,000 searches on a generic informational query.
- Don't dismiss low-volume keywords automatically. A keyword with 50 monthly searches and "hire [service] in [city]" intent can drive direct revenue.
- Combined volume matters for programmatic patterns. "[HVAC marketing in Phoenix]" at 50 searches × 200 cities = 10,000 combined monthly searches.

### Estimating volume without tools
When exact search volume data isn't available, use these proxy signals:
- Google autocomplete suggestions = at least moderate volume
- "People Also Ask" boxes appearing = there's search demand
- Competitor content ranking for this term = someone found it worth targeting
- Related questions on forums (Reddit, Quora) = people actively ask about this

## Circle 4: Competition Gap

**Core question**: "Can we realistically rank for this keyword?"

### Scoring criteria

**High (3)** — Wide open. Signs:
- Competitors haven't published content on this topic
- Top results are thin, outdated, or off-topic
- No major brands dominating the SERP
- Few or no featured snippets claimed

**Medium (2)** — Moderate competition. Signs:
- Competitors have content, but it's not comprehensive
- Some authority sites ranking, but with mediocre content
- Room for a better, more focused piece to break in

**Low (1)** — Highly competitive. Signs:
- Major brands with high domain authority own the top spots
- Existing content is deep, recent, and well-linked
- Featured snippets and SERP features are fully claimed

### Competitor gap analysis
Use these checks from the SEO Audit framework:
- **Keyword overlap**: Shared rankings and your relative position
- **Keyword gaps**: Terms they rank for that you don't cover at all
- **SERP feature ownership**: Who owns featured snippets, PAA, image packs?
- **Content depth comparison**: Average word count, topic breadth, publishing frequency

## Circle 5: Purchase Intent

**Core question**: "Is someone searching this close to buying?"

### Intent classification

| Intent | Signals | Value for Conversion |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **Transactional** | "buy", "pricing", "hire", "book", "near me", "cost" | Highest — ready to act |
| **Commercial** | "best", "vs", "review", "top", "comparison" | High — evaluating options |
| **Navigational** | Brand names, specific products | Medium — looking for you specifically |
| **Informational** | "how to", "what is", "guide", "why does" | Lower — but essential for top-of-funnel |

### Scoring

**High (3)** — Commercial or Transactional intent. Searcher is actively evaluating or ready to buy.

**Medium (2)** — Navigational or mixed intent. The searcher has some purchase consideration but isn't urgent.

**Low (1)** — Pure Informational. The searcher is learning, not buying. Still valuable for:
- Building brand awareness and trust (top-of-funnel)
- Capturing emails via lead magnets embedded in informational content
- Establishing topical authority that boosts commercial pages

### Funnel mapping
Map keywords to buyer stages to ensure balanced coverage:

```
Awareness (Informational)  →  "what is HVAC marketing"
Consideration (Commercial) →  "best HVAC marketing agency"
Decision (Transactional)   →  "hire HVAC marketing agency phoenix"
```

A healthy content strategy covers all three stages, but quick wins should prioritize Commercial and Transactional when possible.

## Circle 6: Content Gap

**Core question**: "Is the current content serving this keyword actually good?"

### Scoring criteria

**High (3)** — Current results are poor. Signs:
- Top results are outdated (2+ years old)
- Content is thin (under 500 words with no depth)
- Wrong format (walls of text when a comparison table would be better)
- Generic advice with no specifics, examples, or data
- Missing key subtopics that searchers care about

**Medium (2)** — Current results are adequate. Signs:
- Some decent content exists but has gaps
- Published within the last 1-2 years
- Covers the basics but lacks depth in specific areas

**Low (1)** — Current results are excellent. Signs:
- Comprehensive, recent, well-structured content from authority sites
- Multiple strong pieces competing for the top spot
- Hard to add meaningfully without a truly unique angle

### 6-Dimension content gap check
Go beyond surface-level quality. Check these dimensions:

1. **Topic coverage** — Are all important subtopics addressed?
2. **Content freshness** — When was it last updated? (12+ months = stale)
3. **Format fit** — Is the content type appropriate? (A list when a calculator would be better)
4. **Depth** — Does it go deep enough for the searcher's needs?
5. **Funnel alignment** — Does it match the searcher's stage? (Don't give a beginner guide to someone ready to buy)
6. **SERP feature match** — Could you win a featured snippet or PAA box with better formatting?

## Priority Scoring: Putting It All Together

### Weighted formula

```
Priority Score = (Expertise × 1.0) + (Pain × 1.5) + (Volume × 1.0)
               + (Competition Gap × 1.5) + (Intent × 1.2) + (Content Gap × 0.8)
```

**Maximum possible score**: 3×(1.0+1.5+1.0+1.5+1.2+0.8) = 3 × 7.0 = **21.0**

### Tier boundaries
- **Tier A** (score ≥ 15): Immediate priority. These are your best opportunities.
- **Tier B** (score 10-14.9): Strong candidates. Schedule after Tier A.
- **Tier C** (score < 10): Lower priority. Revisit quarterly.

### Star (★) override
Any keyword with **High scores on 3 or more circles** earns a star (★) and moves to Tier A regardless of total score. The logic: a keyword that hits the right audience, has low competition, and has a content gap is worth pursuing even if volume is low.

### Weight rationale

| Circle | Weight | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Business Expertise | 1.0 (baseline) | You need to be able to write it, but expertise alone isn't enough |
| Audience Pain | 1.5 (highest) | Audience fit is everything. Wrong audience = wasted content |
| Search Volume | 1.0 (baseline) | Important but not decisive — low-volume + high-intent can be very valuable |
| Competition Gap | 1.5 (highest) | Your ability to actually rank determines ROI. No gap = no ranking |
| Purchase Intent | 1.2 (elevated) | Higher intent = closer to revenue. Tiebreaker between similar keywords |
| Content Gap | 0.8 (lowest) | Nice to have, but less controllable. Great content can sometimes overcome strong competition |

## Business Type Deep Dives

### Info / Education (Courses, Coaching, Content Creators)

**SEO role**: Traffic → Nurture. SEO drives awareness; email converts.

**Keyword strategy**:
- Prioritize **Informational** keywords that demonstrate expertise
- Target "how to" and "what is" queries extensively
- Build educational content pillars (guides, tutorials, frameworks)
- Use lead magnets (cheat sheets, templates) embedded in informational content to capture emails

**Programmatic opportunity**: Topic-based expansion ("how to [skill] for [audience segment]")

**Pillar example**:
```
Pillar: "Email Marketing for Course Creators"
├── How to build an email list from scratch
├── Best email platforms for course creators
├── 7 email sequences every course needs
├── Email marketing vs social media for courses
└── FAQ: Email marketing questions for educators
```

### Consulting / Agency

**SEO role**: Primary stack. SEO is how clients find you.

**Keyword strategy**:
- Prioritize **Commercial** keywords where prospects evaluate options
- Target "[service] in [location]" programmatically
- Build case study and results-driven content
- Create "how we did it" content that proves methodology

**Programmatic opportunity**: High fit. "[service] in [city]" scales massively. Also "[industry] + [service type]" (e.g., "SEO for dentists", "PPC for lawyers")

**Pillar example**:
```
Pillar: "HVAC Marketing Services"
├── HVAC marketing in Phoenix (programmatic × 50 cities)
├── How to choose an HVAC marketing agency
├── HVAC marketing cost guide
├── Case study: How we generated 150 leads for an HVAC company
└── HVAC marketing vs DIY: the real cost comparison
```

### E-commerce

**SEO role**: Primary stack. Organic traffic directly drives revenue.

**Keyword strategy**:
- Prioritize **Transactional** keywords tied to products
- Target "[product] for [audience]" and "[product] vs [product]" comparisons
- Build category pages with rich content, not just product listings
- Create buying guides and "best [product]" roundups

**Programmatic opportunity**: High fit. Product × attribute combinations, "[product] for [use case]", "[brand] vs [brand]".

### SaaS

**SEO role**: Secondary stack. SEO builds consideration; product-led growth converts.

**Keyword strategy**:
- Balance **Commercial** (comparison, alternative) and **Informational** (how-to, integration)
- Target "[your product] vs [competitor]" pages aggressively
- Build integration and use-case content ("[your tool] + [popular tool]")
- Create feature-specific landing pages for bottom-of-funnel traffic

**Programmatic opportunity**: Medium fit. "[tool] vs [tool]" comparison pages, "[tool] for [industry]", integration pages.

**Pillar example**:
```
Pillar: "Project Management for Remote Teams"
├── [Your tool] vs Asana for remote teams
├── [Your tool] vs Monday.com: honest comparison
├── How to set up [your tool] for distributed teams
├── Remote project management best practices
└── [Your tool] + Slack integration guide
