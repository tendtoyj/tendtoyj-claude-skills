| Image alt text | Required; describe content and purpose |
| Callout boxes | Use for tips, warnings, key takeaways |
| Code formatting | Inline `code` for technical terms, blocks for examples |

## Punctuation & Emphasis

| Element | Policy |

| Exclamation marks | Max 1 per piece; never in headlines; never consecutive (!!) |
| Ellipsis (...) | Avoid in professional content; OK in casual social posts |
| ALL CAPS | Never for emphasis; use bold instead |
| Question marks | OK in headlines when genuinely asking the reader |
| Semicolons | Use sparingly; prefer shorter sentences |

## Terminology Standards

### Common Web/Tech Terms

| ✅ Use This | ❌ Not This | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| sign up (verb) | signup (verb) | "signup" = noun/adjective |
| log in (verb) | login (verb) | "login" = noun/adjective |
| set up (verb) | setup (verb) | "setup" = noun/adjective |
| email | e-mail | No hyphen |
| website | web site | One word |
| ecommerce | e-commerce | Trending toward no hyphen |
| homepage | home page | One word |
| internet | Internet | Lowercase (AP style since 2016) |
| OK | okay / ok | AP style |

### Product Naming Rules

- Always use official capitalization for product names
- First mention: full product name; subsequent: shorthand OK
- Decide: "the" before product name? (e.g., "the Platform" vs "Platform")
- Version references: "v2" or "Version 2" — pick one and be consistent
- ™ / ® symbols: first mention in legal docs only; omit in marketing copy

## Inclusive Language Guide

### Gender-Neutral Language
- Use "they/them" for unknown individuals
- "Salesperson" not "salesman"; "team" not "guys"
- "Chairperson" or "chair" not "chairman"
- "Partner" or "spouse" not "husband/wife" (when gender unknown)

### Ableist Language to Avoid

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead |
|----------|---------------|
| crazy / insane | unexpected, surprising, intense |
| blind spot | gap, oversight, missed area |
| lame | ineffective, weak, underwhelming |
| crippling | debilitating, severe, significant |
| tone deaf | out of touch, insensitive |
| falls on deaf ears | goes unheard, is ignored |
| dumb | uninformed, misguided |

### Culturally Sensitive Language
- Avoid idioms that don't translate globally ("hit it out of the park")
- Use "straightforward" instead of "easy" (difficulty is subjective)
- Avoid war metaphors where possible ("battle-tested" → "proven")
- Be mindful of culturally specific references

### Acronyms & Jargon

**Rule**: Spell out on first use, then acronym in parentheses. Use acronym only after that.

Example: "Search Engine Optimization (SEO) helps your content rank. SEO requires..."

**Exceptions** (universally known, no need to spell out):
- URL, HTML, CSS, PDF, API
- Add your industry's universally known terms here

**Always define**:
- Industry-specific terms your audience may not know
- Internal product terminology
- New or emerging concepts

## Channel-Specific Style Notes

### Blog / Long-form
- Target reading level: 8th grade (use Hemingway or similar to check)
- Paragraph length: 1-3 sentences max
- Subheading every 200-300 words
- Include at least one image/visual per 500 words

### Email
- Subject line: Under 50 characters
- Preview text: Complement (don't repeat) the subject
- One primary CTA per email
- Plain text version for every HTML email

### Social Media
- LinkedIn: No hashtag overload (3-5 max); line breaks for readability
- Twitter/X: Front-load the hook; use threads for depth
- Instagram: Hashtags in first comment (not caption) for cleanliness

### Landing Pages
- Headline: 10 words or fewer
- One CTA per section
- Social proof near every CTA
- Mobile-first formatting (short lines, large touch targets)
